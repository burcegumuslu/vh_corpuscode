Instead, clouds rolled in from the southwest; a cool breeze swept into Harkness Plaza; and more than 400 staff, faculty, friends, and family members gathered under a tent outside Harkness Hall to watch as the School of Medicine\u2019s Class of 2022 opened a new chapter of their lives.\n\u201cToday represents the culmination of decades of commitment on your part and on the part of our newest students,\u201d said Robert J. Alpern, MD, dean and Ensign Professor of Medicine, addressing the families of the incoming class. To the class, he said, \u201cToday is a momentous day in your evolution to become a physician.\u201d\nAlpern welcomed the new cohort of 104 scholars representing 55 colleges, including 15 Yalies. This class, as it has been since the mid-1990s, is almost evenly split between women and men (50 and 54 respectively), and includes 19 MD/PhD students. Almost a quarter of the class arrives from abroad, including students from Vietnam, China, and Canada.\nIn her keynote address, Nita Ahuja, MD, MBA, chair and the William H. Carmalt Professor of Surgery, described a doctor\u2019s responsibility for her patients. \u201cThe bond between you and your patient is supreme,\u201d she said. Drawing on her own experiences with patients and her own thoughts and feelings on care, Ahuja urged the future doctors to prioritize generosity and empathy in their public and private lives. At the core of healing, she said, lies an obligation not only to do no harm but also to strive to do good.\n\u201cAlthough the medical school will change you, ultimately you\u2019re the ones who will change the practice of medicine,\u201d she said, before closing by welcoming the Class of 2022 to the \u201cnoble profession.\u201d\nAs Ayaska Fernando, the school\u2019s new director of admissions, called the young medical students forward, they filed one by one across the stage to receive their white coats from faculty and administrators as well as the gift of a stethoscope from the president and vice president of the Association of Yale Alumni in Medicine.\nThe ceremony carries great symbolic meaning: it marks a beginning, and the physician\u2019s white coat has long been associated with healing and purity. At Yale the ceremony is a tradition dating back to 1992, when Nicholas Spinelli, MD \u201944, donated money so that his beloved alma mater could conduct the ceremony.\nStudents and families mingled after the ceremony at a reception that spilled over from the Harkness Courtyard and Ballroom. Susana Della Latta, the mother of Victor Diego Armengol, a student who had graduated from Harvard, said that her son had medicine in his blood and had wanted to be a doctor since childhood. \u201cOn my side of the family and on his father\u2019s side, there are researchers and physicians going back generations,\u201d said Della Latta, an artist.\nChloe Dlott, a student from California who had graduated with a major in biology and a minor in literature from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was grateful that her parents could attend, and said that she was enjoying getting to know her classmates. \u201cIt was amazing to see my peers in the context of the ceremony,\u201d Dlott said, \u201cThey\u2019re all so impressive.\u201d", "language": null, "image":
