For many professions, holding an active Washington license provides sufficient authority to administer vaccines. For others , \nadditional requirements may need to be met before you may begin administering vaccines.  \nYou need to be authorized under only one  category , but you may be authorized under  multiple . If you are authorized under multiple  categories , \nall are legally valid alternative pathways to administering vaccines, but one of the categories  may have less burdensome requirements for you \nto meet. If you meet the requirements of one category , you do not need to meet the requirements of another category . For instance, if you \nmeet the requirements of the HHS PREP Act authorization, then you do not need to meet state law requirements, such as those f or su pervision \nor training.   \n \n1 The PREP Act generally provides immunity from suit and liability with respect to all claims for loss caused by, arising out o f, relating to, or resulting from the administration of \nCOVID -19 vaccines. This immunity applies equally to people who are eligibl e to administer COVID -19 vaccines under an active Washington license and those who are eligible \npursuant to an authorization issued under the PREP Act.
