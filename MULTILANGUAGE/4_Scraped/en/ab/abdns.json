Here's what to know about dogs and tetanus.", "sitename": "Whole Dog Journal", "date": "2018-05-18", "id": null, "license": null, "body": null, "comments": "", "commentsbody": null, "raw_text": null, "text": "Your canine companion is walking calmly with you one minute, and the next, a rabbit! Off streaks your dog, ignoring your calls and bent on chasing the rabbit. Unfortunately for him, he doesn\u2019t notice the rusty old wire fence stretching across the landscape and runs right through it. Abashed, he returns to you with superficial wounds from the barbed wire on his legs and face. Your mind races: Do dogs get tetanus? Should your dog get a tetanus shot now?\nYes: Dogs can get tetanus. But, no, you couldn\u2019t get him a tetanus vaccine even if you wanted to.\nFortunately, tetanus is relatively rare in dogs. Horses and humans are more susceptible to tetanus, while cats are highly resistant. Dogs fall somewhere in the middle of this spectrum \u2013 but it does happen. As an emergency veterinarian, I have personally seen two cases of tetanus in dogs and read of several others.\nThe disease arises from the bacteria Clostridium tetani, which is introduced into the body via wounds. C. tetani is naturally present in some soils. Despite what many people think, C. tetani is not a particular hazard of rusty metal; it\u2019s the dirt on rusty metal \u2013 as well as metal that is not at all rusty! \u2013 that carries C. tetani into a wound.\nAnother surprise is that the bacteria itself is not the problem. Rather, the tetanus malady is caused by a neurotoxin (\u201ctetanospasmin\u201d) that is produced by the bacteria after it is introduced to an oxygen-deprived setting (as in puncture wounds) and it begins to reproduce. The toxin binds to tissue in the nervous system and causes the classic signs of tetanus. In dogs, these signs include painful muscle contractions and stiffness or rigidity of the limb nearest the site of infection. This can progress to generalized signs that include r\nigidity in all four limbs known as the \u201csawhorse stance.\u201d The more classic presentation of tetanus is a dog with rictus sardonicus (\u201csardonic grin\u201d). The ears are pulled tightly back, as are the lips. The eyes bulge, and the dog appears to be grinning.\nTreatment for tetanus consists mainly of general supportive care while the dog\u2019s nervous system recovers from the damage caused by exposure to the neurotoxin. Dogs with generalized tetanus cannot walk. They require attentive nursing care with soft bedding, frequent rotation to avoid decubital ulcers (\u201cbed sores\u201d), hand feeding or feeding by a nasogastric or gastric tube, assistance with expressing their bladder, and minimal stimulation. Recovery can take weeks or even months, but if they are provided with excellent nursing care, many dogs will survive.\nTetanus Prevention for Dogs\nSo, back to your furry friend and his barbed wire injuries. He has wounds on his nose from rusty metal. Now what? Shouldn\u2019t he receive a tetanus vaccine?\nAs it turns out, he can\u2019t! There are multiple FDA-approved tetanus toxoid vaccines for humans, horses, and sheep. Unfortunately, there are none for dogs. Since tetanus is relatively rare in dogs, the sales of a tetanus toxoid vaccine for dogs would likely never pay off the expense of its development by a pharmaceutical company, so it\u2019s no surprise that it hasn\u2019t yet been developed. Money aside, there are also ethical considerations to vaccine development: To study whether a toxoid vaccine works in dogs, researchers would be required to infect dogs with tetanus and then treat them. The infection and resulting illness, treatment, and possible side effects of the vaccines would cause significant suffering and some deaths in the research animals. On balance, the endeavor hasn\u2019t yet appealed to any vaccine developer.\nSince there is not a readily available vaccine against tetanus for your dog, how can you protect your dog from the condition?\nFirst and foremost, you should clean any wound thoroughly and with care, following the\n[suggestions in the accompanying article](/issues/21_6/features/How-to-Treat-Dog-Wounds_21853-1.html).\nBites and puncture wounds are at special risk of developing tetanus; bring these to your vet!\nNext, monitor your dog carefully after he sustains any open wound. If you notice stiffness at the site of the injury, do not wait to have your dog seen by a veterinarian. The more quickly tetanus is detected and treated, the better your dog\u2019s prognosis will be.", "language": null, "image":
