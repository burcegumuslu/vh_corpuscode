It also helps to understand the Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) clinical trial details, expressive pharmacological action, agreements and collaborations, approval and patent details, advantages and disadvantages of each included drug and the latest news and press releases.\n\nSodium Fusidate (Arrevus) is the only member of a unique class of antibiotics, called fusidanes, and has a mechanism of action that differs from any other antibiotic. It is active against gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains (MRSA) and interferes with the function of elongation factor G (EF-G), leading to the inhibition of protein synthesis. The product has completed II/III studies for the treatment of PJI and has also received Orphan designation. It has been approved in Europe but never been approved in the US, therefore its approval will lead to a good market share in the US.\n\nThe Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) market outlook of the report helps to build the detailed comprehension of the historic, current and forecasted Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) market trends by analyzing the impact of current therapies on the market, unmet needs, drivers and barriers and demand of better technology.\n\nThis segment gives a thorough detail of Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) market trend of each marketed drug and late-stage pipeline therapy by evaluating their impact based on annual cost of therapy, inclusion and exclusion criteria\u2019s, mechanism of action, compliance rate, growing need of the market, increasing patient pool, covered patient segment, expected launch year, competition with other therapies, brand value, their impact on the market and view of the key opinion leaders. The calculated market data are presented with relevant tables and graphs to give a clear view of the market at first sight.\n\nThe current therapeutic landscape in the 7MM of PJI usually requires combined medical-surgical strategies, including open or arthroscopic debridement without removal of the prosthesis, resection of the prosthesis with or without reimplantation either at the time of removal or delayed by weeks to months. Further arthrodesis, amputation, or antimicrobial suppression without surgery are also recommended.\n\nAntimicrobial therapy should be pathogen directed and guided by the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, where applicable. General principles for antimicrobial treatment apply, with priority given to the least toxic, most efficacious, narrow-spectrum antimicrobial regimen.\n\nThe generally used antibiotics are Cefazolin, Rifampin, Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin, Penicillin, Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin, Gentamicin, Clindamycin, and others. These antibiotics may be used as monotherapy or combination therapy depending on the type of microorganisms\n\nThis section includes a glimpse of the Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) market in 7MM. The market size of PJI in the seven major markets was found to be USD 57.69 million in 2017.\n\nThis section provides the total Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) market size and market size by therapies in the United States. The United States accounts for the highest market size of PJI in comparison to the EU5 (the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, France, and Spain) and Japan.\n\nThe total Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) market size and market size by therapies in Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom are provided in this section. Given the heterogeneous nature of prosthetic joint infections, there are no large randomized control trials to guide recommendations. Surgical strategies differ significantly worldwide; exchange procedures are the favored treatment modality in Northern America, whereas debridement and retention are more commonly performed in Europe. One-stage or direct arthroplasty exchange - preferred more in Europe; Two-stage arthroplasty exchange - preferred more in the US.\n\nThe total Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) market Size and market Size by therapies in Japan are also mentioned.\n\nThis section focusses on the rate of uptake of the potential drugs recently launched or expected to get launched in the market during the study period 2017-2030. The analysis covers Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) market uptake by drugs; patient uptake by therapies; and sales of each drug.\n\nThis helps in understanding the drugs with the most rapid uptake, reasons behind the maximal use of new drugs and allow the comparison of the drugs on the basis of market share and size which again will be useful in investigating factors important in the market uptake and in making financial and regulatory decisions.\n\nThe report provides insights into different therapeutic candidates in Phase II, and Phase III stage. It also analyses Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) key players involved in developing targeted therapeutics. Major players include Arrevus, TenNor Therapeutics, Peptilogics and others.\n\nApproaching reimbursement proactively can have a positive impact both during the late stages of product development and well after product launch. In the report, we take reimbursement into consideration to identify economically attractive indications and market opportunities. When working with finite resources, the ability to select the markets with the fewest reimbursement barriers can be a critical business & price strategy.\n\nThe government is the primary payer for the majority of PJI cases, through Medicare spending. In addition to improving patient outcomes, prevention of PJI may save costs to the Medicare program. Several reimbursements and other strategies are on the horizon that will impact provider compensation for physicians and hospitals\n\nTo keep up with current market trends, we take KOLs and SME\u2019s opinion working in Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) domain through primary research to fill the data gaps and validate our secondary research.
