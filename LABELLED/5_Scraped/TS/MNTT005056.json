In 2020 alone, over 19 million new cases of the disease (affecting different organs) and close 10 million associated fatalities, were reported worldwide. Over the next couple of decades, experts believe that the global cancer burden is likely to increase by almost 50%. Currently, a variety of therapeutic measures are available for the treatment of different types of cancers; of these, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, are considered the current standards of care.\n\nHowever, the efficacy of the aforementioned procedures has been shown to be severely limited, especially in treating advanced-stage cancers that have metastasized beyond their respective points of origin.\n\nAdditionally, the non-specific and highly toxic nature of both chemotherapy and radiation therapy is known to significantly deteriorate quality of life.\n\nOver the last couple of decades, several targeted, anti-cancer therapies have been developed, and many are already available in the market. Of these, immune checkpoint directed therapies, which are designed to prevent malignantly transformed cells from evading immune surveillance, have demonstrated a lot of potential in treating a variety of cancer types.\n\nThe programmed cell death protein 1 receptor (PD-1) receptor, and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) are known to negatively regulate T-cell-mediated immune responses. Multiple studies have shown that the activation of PD-1 / PD-L1 signaling is a mechanism used by tumors to evade a T-cell based immunological response.\n\nThis led to the development of the hypothesis that PD-1 / PD-L1 blockade may prove to be an effective form of anti-cancer therapy that is capable of harnessing the key mediators of the adaptive human immune system. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), the first PD-1 targeting anti-cancer therapy was approved by the FDA in September 2014 for the treatment of patients suffering from advanced / unresectable melanoma who were no longer responding to other forms of treatment. Later, in the same year, OPDIVO (nivolumab), another PD-1 targeting therapy, was approved by the FDA.\n\nThese immune checkpoint inhibitors soon demonstrated the fact that they were both viable and potent therapeutic options and had the ability to substantially prolong the lives of patients suffering from advanced stage tumors. As a result, till date, there are seven approved drugs against PD-1 and PD-L1, and several more under development.\n\nDrug developers are now capitalizing on the success of PD-1 blockade in several different types of malignancies, and also researching alternative areas of application. Consequently, this field of research is abuzz with activity both at the clinical and preclinical levels. This report provides a deeper perspective on some of the recently published results from completed and ongoing clinical research activity.\n\u2022 The \u201cImmune Checkpoint Inhibitors (PD-1 & PD-L1 Targeting Drugs): Analysis of Clinical Trial Results\u201d report provides detailed information on the contemporary R&D efforts related to an important segment of the immune checkpoint inhibitors market, specifically the drugs / drug candidates that have been developed to target the PD-1 and PD-L1 molecules.
