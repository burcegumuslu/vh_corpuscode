There definitely is a very toxic side to social media of people living unattainable lives but then there is another side of people with disabilities or going though chronic illnesses showing you that if you're going through a hard time there are other people who can relate to you.\"\n\n'Doctor to patient and back to doctor'", "opengraph": {"article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "description": "Eleri Reece-Jones has been documenting her story online to help inspire others.", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/45CD/production/_123196871_tt4.jpg", "image:alt": "Eleri Reece-Jones", "locale": "en_GB", "site_name": "BBC News", "title": "Cancer: TikTok medical student gets all-clear from disease", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-60319259", "article:section": "Wales"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hodgkin-lymphoma/", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-55871140", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-55320004", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08nkjqw/episodes/downloads?xtor=CS8-1000-%5BIn_Article_Promo_Box%5D-%5BNews_Promo_In_Article%5D-%5BNews_Promo_In_Article_BBCGeneric_BBCWales%5D-%5BBBC_DEFAULT~N~p08nkjqw~Hayley_Pearce_Podcast%5D", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0013yd0?xtor=CS8-1000-%5BIn_Article_Promo_Box%5D-%5BNews_Promo_In_Article%5D-%5BNews_Promo_In_Article_BBCSounds_BBCWales%5D-%5BPS_SOUNDS~C~m0013yd0~I_was_there%5D", "/news/wales", "/news/topics/c207p54m4pdt", "/news/topics/c255806071xt", "/news/topics/c2rndyzkwg8t", "/news/topics/c34vnl2xl5pt", "/news/topics/c6v7ggvqylyt", "/news/topics/cdl8n2edgxgt", "/news/topics/cg41ylwvwpet", "/news/topics/cx1m7zg0w18t", "/news/topics/cxrlk204z04t", "/news/topics/cywd23g0q11t", "/news/coronavirus", "/news/topics/cz4pr2gdggdt", "/news/uk-wales-55985368", "/news/uk-wales-60317164", "/news/uk-wales-60258648"], "authors": ["BBC News"], "publish_date": "2022-02-25T22:58:22.000Z"}
