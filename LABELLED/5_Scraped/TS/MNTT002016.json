Sheff was baffled; his son transformed from an intelligent student and athlete into an addict living on the streets. At first he thought Nic was just being a wild teenager who needed some tough love. But after struggling to find Nic treatment \u2014 and keep him alive \u2014 Sheff realized that his son was dealing with a serious disease, more similar than different from diabetes, hypertension or even cancer.\n\nWith his personal experience and more than 10 years of research, Sheff concluded that addiction is a health crisis with a price tag of $600 billion in combined medical, economic, criminal and social costs every year.\n\nIn a follow-up to his memoir \u201cBeautiful Boy,\u201d David Sheff has written a new book, \u201cClean: Overcoming Addiction and Ending America\u2019s Greatest Tragedy,\u201d in order to outline a slew of reasons why society and addiction treatments have largely failed to help the 20 million Americans with addictions.\n\nSheff asserts that the reason that addiction treatments overwhelmingly fail is because of how we view addiction. And he says correcting common misconceptions about the disease can be the first step towards improving the social support and medical treatment systems for those struggling with their addictions.\n\nBelow are the top myths about addiction, according to David Sheff. Do you agree or disagree? Let PBS NewsHour know what you think by leaving your comments in the discussion section at the bottom of the page.\n\nMyth No. 1: Good kids don\u2019t use drugs, bad kids do.\n\nAs our children grow up, we \u2014 parents, teachers, the culture as a whole \u2014 tell them that good kids abstain, bad ones use. Yet 80 percent of America\u2019s children will at least try alcohol or other drugs. Do we really believe that most of our children are bad? As a pediatrician told me: \u201cThese aren\u2019t bad kids. They\u2019re our kids.\u201d\n\nBy moralizing the choice to use or not, we\u2019re alienating our kids. This isn\u2019t a question of good and bad, it\u2019s a question of health and safety. If we keep this in mind, we can better help our kids grow up without succumbing to drugs and continuing to use, trying new and more dangerous drugs, and even become addicted.\n\n\n\nMyth No. 2: It\u2019s impossible to prevent drug use. Kids who are going to use are going to use.\n\nWe\u2019ve failed to prevent use because we\u2019ve done most things wrong by focusing on drugs as a criminal and moral problem, and on scare tactics and hyperbole. Prevention efforts will be effective when we focus not on \u201cjust say no\u201d tactics, but instead address the reasons kids use.\n\nKids who have drug problems often use drugs as a way to alleviate stress and otherwise help them cope with stressful lives. Kids who experienced trauma are more likely to have drug problems. The list of risk factors goes on: those growing up in poverty or violent neighborhoods, children whose parents divorce or suffer loss, those with addiction, including alcoholism, in their family, young people with ADHD, with learning disabilities, with a host of psychological disorders including depression and bipolar disorder.\n\nWe\u2019ll effectively lower or potentially prevent drug use when we address these risk factors and replace them with protective factors.\n\n\n\nMyth No. 3: People who get addicted are weak and without morals.\n\nAddiction is a disease. This isn\u2019t about character. People who think that addicts are weak assume that will power is enough for a person to stop using.\n\nSo if weakness isn\u2019t the reason why, when someone\u2019s life is negatively affected by their drug use, why don\u2019t they just stop? It\u2019s because their brains have altered so the new \u201cnormal\u201d is the presence of drugs.\n\nDependence is real, not a choice, biologically rooted, and therefore addicts must be treated. It\u2019s critical that people understand that addiction is a serious illness, usually chronic and progressive and often fatal. Addiction is the cause for 120,000 deaths each year.\n\n\n\nMyth No. 4: Addicts must hit bottom before they can be treated.\n\nThis myth kills addicts. Don\u2019t wait for an addict to hit bottom; do everything you can to get them into treatments. Addicts are often told that they must hit bottom, but they need to know that people who enter treatment can and do get well. Many people die before they hit a bottom. We must reject this archaic belief.\n\n\n\nMyth No. 5: You don\u2019t treat drug problems with drugs.\n\nWrong again. Many addiction treatments can and should include medication. A variety of medications, when prescribed, monitored, and adjusted by a good psychiatrist, in combination with behavioral therapies, dramatically up the odds of\n\n successful treatment.\n\nFor many addicts, the impact of medications can be profound \u2014 even lifesaving. And for addicts with concurrent mental illnesses, drugs can be essential. Some of the same medications that help during detox can be part of primary care. Some of these prescriptions inhibit cravings. Some treat the symptoms that come with sobriety following intense and consistent drug use. Some replacement drugs not only reduce cravings but act as deterrents; they block certain drugs from attaching to receptors, thereby preventing the drugs from triggering a high if they\u2019re taken. In addition, medications can treat the concurrent and underlying problems, including anxiety, depression, and other disorders, that contribute to addiction.\n\n\n\nMyth No. 6: The only way for addicts to stop using is by going to AA meetings.\n\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) and the Twelve Steps have helped countless addicts get and stay sober. It\u2019s a profound program that works for many people. But it doesn\u2019t work for a majority of addicts.\n\nPeople must know that there are other treatments that are effective. Some are used in concert with AA, but AA isn\u2019t a requirement to managing addiction. When treatment programs insist that patients must practice the Steps, they can alienate some addicts, often teenagers.\n\nEffective programs should offer many types of treatment, including behavioral and psychological treatments. As I said, some addictions should be treated with medication in addition to behavioral treatments.\n\n\n\nMyth No. 7: Marijuana is not addictive. No one\u2019s ever died from marijuana. It\u2019s not a gateway drug. Marijuana shouldn\u2019t be legalized.\n\nMarijuana should be legalized, but not because it\u2019s safe, especially for teenagers and young adults. It should be legalized because we must treat marijuana use like all drug use \u2014 as a health issue. The fact that it is illegal just drives using marijuana underground. The last thing we want to do is increase those things by kicking kids out of school or throwing them into the criminal justice system because they were caught smoking pot.\n\nBut those who support legalization by saying that pot is harmless \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s natural, innocuous\u201d \u2014 are also wrong. Marijuana is dangerous for kids. Part of the reason is that their brains are developing during adolescence and early adulthood. Drugs impede and alter the brain development, and these changes can harm cognition and memory, and can impede kids\u2019 emotional maturation.\n\nMarijuana is a gateway drug for some kids who smoke; I\u2019ve never met an addict who started on heroin \u2014 it\u2019s always pot and drinking. And marijuana is addictive for about 7 percent of those who try it. Yes, people don\u2019t overdose and die from smoking pot, but those who drive while high are twice as likely to get in car accidents, including ones that are fatal.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve failed at solving America\u2019s drug problem not because it\u2019s impossible to do so, but we\u2019ve been focusing on the wrong things. The main problem is that we\u2019ve treated drug use as a criminal problem and drug users as morally bankrupt.\n\nThere are several developments that make me optimistic that we can lower drug use, treat addicts and potentially solve many of the problems in America caused by addiction:\n\u2022 There\u2019s a growing understanding and acceptance that addiction is a disease and must be treated like we treat other diseases.\n\u2022 There are advances in treatment that will dramatically improve the likelihood that addicts will get well. There are also new prevention strategies, early assessment, and brief intervention strategies that work.\n\u2022 There is progress toward making sure that people who need treatment will be able to find programs that use evidence-based treatment.\n\u2022 There is a new organization founded called Brian\u2019s Wish To End Addiction \u2014 modeled after the American Cancer Society \u2014 that will work to educate the American public, support research and lobby Congress, all in order to improve addiction treatment and care. The organization is being led by businessmen and scientists determined to unite those throughout America who are working to end this disease.\n\u2022 Sections of the Affordable Care Act that will go into effect in January 2014 will profoundly influence addiction care in America. Insurance will have to cover addiction treatments and other mental illnesses as comprehensively as they cover any other disease. For the first time, insurance will pay for whatever level of treatment is needed. Plus the more money available for treatment, the more jobs there will be for good and highly trained therapists and psychiatrists and other treatment professionals.\n\u2022 There\u2019s a growing movement in America of addicts and family members coming out of the darkness. They are calling for a national and local focus on starting a war on addiction, not on drugs. (I\u2019ve started a petition online that will be presented to President Obama. It\u2019s a model based off the successful 1980s campaign to tackle the AIDS epidemic: Silence = Death. Silence = Death for addiction, too.
