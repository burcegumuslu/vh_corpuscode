Professor Per\u00e1n, Propanc\u2019s Lead Joint Researcher, will also be presenting at the annual EORTC-PAMM meeting to be held in Florence, Italy, December 15 \u2013 17. Topics covered will be innovation and application of pharmacological knowledge to cancer drug discovery and development, with particular regard to innovative and advanced drugs and their mechanisms of action, pharmacometrics and clinical application in oncology. Professor Per\u00e1n, supported by Mrs. Bel\u00e9n Toledo Cutillas MSc and Mr. Aitor Gonz\u00e1lez from Professor Per\u00e1n\u2019s laboratory at Ja\u00e9n University will present findings on the anti-cancer effects of the Company\u2019s lead product candidate, PRP, effects on the tumor microenvironment and upscaling of synthetic recombinant protein production for a backup clinical compound for PRP.\n\nThe EORTC is a prestigious and globally recognized organization with significant resources and outreach. Mr. Nathanielsz looks forward to attending the 43 rd EORTC-PAMM meeting with Ja\u00e9n and Granada Universities, as part of the Joint Research Collaboration Project. Propanc\u2019s goal is to produce a non, toxic, long-term therapy for the treatment and prevention of metastatic cancer from solid tumors by targeting and eradicating cancer stem cells, and as an adjunct therapy to pre-treat resistant tumors.\n\n\u201cAttendance at the EORTC-PAMM meeting provides an exciting opportunity to meet with scientific experts and clinical researchers who are at the cutting edge of cancer drug development, which presents an opportunity to discuss recent scientific discoveries from our PRP, R&D project and its potential clinical applications as a pre-treatment with existing innovative cancer therapies,\u201d said Mr. Nathanielsz, Propanc\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. \u201cProfessor Per\u00e1n has uncovered how PRP treats and prevents metastatic cancer by targeting and eradicating cancer stem cells via differentiation (turning back), so they become benign and are no longer malignant, without affecting healthy cells. She is also investigating the effects of PRP on the tumor microenvironment, where resistant tumors become susceptible to standard therapies, post treatment with PRP. We are excited to present our research with Professor Per\u00e1n as we investigate future clinical applications of PRP in controlled human studies.\u201d\n\nThe EORTC\u2019s mission is to increase people\u2019s survival and quality of life by testing new therapeutic strategies based on existing drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. The EORTC also helps develop new drugs and approaches in partnership with the pharmaceutical industry and in patients\u2019 best interests. The EORTC research network consists of over 5,500 collaborators from all disciplines involved in cancer treatment and research in more than 930 institutions in 27 countries. Its research spans the entire spectrum from translational and preclinical research to large, prospective, multi-center, phase III clinical trials that evaluate new cancer therapies.\n\nPropanc is currently undertaking two joint research and collaboration projects with the Universities of J\u00e1en and Granada. The first project, POP1 (Proenzyme Optimization Project 1) Joint Research and Drug Discovery Program, is designed to produce a back clinical compound to PRP, which is targeting metastatic cancer from solid tumors. The second involves investigating the effects of proenzyme therapy and the impact on the tumor microenvironment, which is key to the development, invasion, metastatic spread and recurrence of solid tumors. This has potential implications for future clinical applications of PRP as a potential pre-treatment for resistant tumors. According to Emergen Research, the global metastatic cancer market is projected to be worth $111 Billion by 2027. Propanc is undertaking these challenging research projects in collaboration with the Universities of Ja\u00e9n and Granada, led by Professors Per\u00e1n and Juan Antonio Marchal MD, representing the Universities, respectively, and Dr Kenyon, MD, MB, ChB, Propanc\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer.\n\nPRP is a mixture of two proenzymes, trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen from bovine pancreas administered by intravenous injection. A synergistic ratio of 1:6 inhibits growth of most tumor cells. Examples include kidney, ovarian, breast, brain, prostate, colorectal, lung, liver, uterine and skin cancers.\n\nAs an independent, non-governmental, non-profit cancer research Organization established under the laws of Belgium, its mission is to coordinate and conduct international translational and clinical research to improve the standard of cancer treatment for patients.\n\nEORTC aims ultimately to increase people\u2019s survival and quality of life by testing new therapeutic strategies based on existing drugs, surgery, and radiotherapy. EORTC also helps develop new approaches with the pharmaceutical industry and in patients\u2019 best interests.\n\nIn addition to independence, EORTC is recognized for scientific and methodological rigor bringing robust datasets to doctors and patients for therapeutic improvement. EORTC covers all disciplines to fight against cancer. EORTC research leaves no one behind and addresses all patients, including patients with rare tumors and specific patient populations.\n\nProfessor Macarena Per\u00e1n graduated with a B. S. in Biology and a M.S. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in 1996 from the University of M\u00e1laga, Spain. She moved to the Neuroscience Department at Durham University, UK, where she was awarded with a Marie Curie Fellowship and graduated in 2000 with a Ph.D. She moved back to Spain and completed a postdoctoral program in the Faculty of Medicine at Granada University.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006 Macarena went to Bath University, UK, and was a short-term postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Biology & Biochemistry in Professor David Tosh\u2019s laboratory, where she first studied the anti-cancer effects of proenzymes in collaboration with Propanc Biopharma Inc. Professor Per\u00e1n is a Reader in Anatomy, University of Jaen, Spain and belongs to the Institute for Regenerative Medicine and Pathobiology (IBIMER).\n\nAbout the University of Ja\u00e9n:\n\nThe University of Ja\u00e9n is among the Top 50 of the best young universities in the world according to THE (Times Higher Education). Likewise, the University of Ja\u00e9n received the EFQM 500+ European Seal of Excellence, the highest level of recognition awarded by the Excellence in Management Club, as the official representative of the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) in Spain. It also stands out in the field of computing, since the University of Ja\u00e9n is among the 75 best universities in the world, according to Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) 2017.\n\nThe University of Ja\u00e9n is repeatedly in the top 4% of universities worldwide, according to the Ranking Center for World University Rankings (CWUR), which annually collects the thousand best and most valued among the more than 25,000 existing universities. In addition, it is the fourth Spanish university that has obtained the highest score in the ranking of international student satisfaction, published by the STEXX International Studyportals Organization, in its 2016 version.\n\nPropanc Biopharma, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) is developing a novel approach to prevent recurrence and metastasis of solid tumors by using pancreatic proenzymes that target and eradicate cancer stem cells in patients suffering from pancreatic, ovarian and colorectal cancers. For more information, please visit .\n\nThe Company\u2019s novel proenzyme therapy is based on the science that enzymes stimulate biological reactions in the body, especially enzymes secreted by the pancreas. These pancreatic enzymes could represent the body\u2019s primary defense against cancer.\n\nTo view the Company\u2019s \u201cMechanism of Action\u201d video on its anti-cancer lead product candidate, PRP, please click on the following link:\n\nAll statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this press release are \u201cforward-looking statements,\u201d which may often, but not always, be identified by the use of such words as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cmight,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cwill likely result,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cseek,\u201d \u201ccontinue,\u201d \u201ctarget\u201d or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions.
