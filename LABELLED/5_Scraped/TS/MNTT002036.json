Any minors accompanying them were to be taken into government custody.\n\nIn the past, immigrants charged with this misdemeanor were able to stay in shelters with their children while waiting for further direction.\n\nThe story is moving quickly. President Trump declared today that he plans to issue an executive order to end the separation of families at the border by indefinitely detaining parents and children together.\n\nStill, in a six-week period, nearly 2,000 children\u2014some as young as 18 months old\u2014were separated from their caregivers. Yesterday, the Associated Press reported that babies and other young members of this group are living in \u201ctender age\u201d shelters in South Texas.\n\n\u201cI would definitely consider [this] a traumatic experience with long-term consequences,\u201d said Chandra Ghosh Ippen, associate director and dissemination director of the Child Trauma Research Program at the University of California, San Francisco and the Earth Trauma Treatment Network.\n\nWhen a child is separated from his or her parents under chaotic circumstances, a monsoon of stress hormones (like cortisol) floods the brain and the body. These hormones are important for navigating stress in the short-term. However, in high doses, these chemicals\u2014if hyperactive for a prolonged period of time\u2014can increase the risk of lasting, destructive complications like heart disease, diabetes, and even some forms of cancer. In addition, multiples instances of trauma early in life can lead to mental health problems like depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nOn top of this immediate biological response to separation is the frightening experience of watching a caregiver undergo severe emotional upheaval.\n\n\u201cWhen a child sees a parent frightened, it is extremely threatening,\u201d said Lisa Berlin, an associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Social Work and co-author on a study published in 2011 examining the effects of mother-child separation on children under two years old. Regarding that study, Berlin notes that some of the participants experienced planned separations that were done \u201cin an orderly way.\u201d By contrast, she says, \u201cthis is chaos.\u201d\n\nThe conditions under which these undocumented minors are now living are varied and unclear, but ProPublica obtained audio suggesting that the children are under duress.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like, from what we\u2019re hearing, that there aren\u2019t people there to help console them and help them self-soothe, which would be something that would be really key to help offset those biological responses [to stress],\u201d said Erin C. Dunn, a social and psychiatric epidemiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital\u2019s Center for Genomic Medicine.\n\nThe situation is a case study in what psychologists call \u201cattachment,\u201d and it\u2019s the reason why children who are separated from their primary caregivers desperately need replacement care.\n\n\u201cIn early childhood, young children believe that their parents can protect them from anything, and that\u2019s actually what allows them to feel safe enough to explore the world,\u201d Ippen said. \u201cWhen that safe base is disrupted, you might see a child who is very anxious, or who is clingy, or you might see a child who goes off and recklessly explores the world. This is the crux of attachment theory.\u201d\n\nAttachment theory is a set of ideas developed in the early 1950s by British psychiatrist John Bowlby. \u201cIt\u2019s an explanation of why we are the way we are,\u201d Berlin said. \u201c[Bowlby] said that a big determining factor has to do with how much we can rely on our primary caregiver when we really, really need them. We need them for physical safety and because we\u2019re young and immature and we can\u2019t make sense of our world without their help.\u201d\n\nBerlin says that many rigorous research projects since Bowlby\u2019s original writings have demonstrated that these ideas make sense; in other words, empirical evidence has confirmed his theory, as well as how a child\u2019s future development is based on these patterns formed early on.\n\n\u201cEven when children are in the care of parents who may not be able to meet their needs or to keep them safe, they still organize their behaviors and thinking around these relationships and go at great lengths to maintain them,\u201d said Carmen Rosa Noro\u00f1a, Child Trauma Clinical Services and Training Lead of Boston Medical Center\u2019s Child Witness to Violence Project. Moreover, when these attachment relationships are suddenly subverted and there is no other adult who can help the child make meaning\u2014or a story\u2014of what has happened, the child might experience not only a sense of confusion and terror but might also blame himself or herself for losing the parent.\n\n\u201cAll they know is that the people who were there to protect them and help with every little thing are no longer there,\u201d Berlin said.\n\nParents, of course, face similar trauma. Especially in Latin America, the concept of motherhood is heavily linked to the idea of the self-sacrificing woman. \u201c[That identity] permeates across the countries in Latin America,\u201d said Gabrielle Oliveira, an assistant professor at the Lynch School of Education at Boston College and an expert on the concept of \u201ctransnational motherhood,\u201d or the notion that women can engage in the care of their children across borders. Oliveira says that women who decide to migrate with their children to a new country usually view it as a safer option for the whole family than staying put.\n\n\u201cIf the very beneficiary of that crossing gets taken from them, it defeats the entire purpose,\u201d Oliveira said. Yet another layer of guilt gets added to the equation. \u201cThat is so beyond traumatic.\u201d\n\nDunn says that what has happened is especially scary because evidence suggests that the effects of stress and trauma vary based on the age of the child\u2014the youngest children may be the most vulnerable.\n\n\u201cThe scientific evidence against separating children from families is crystal clear,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one in the scientific community would dispute it\u2014it\u2019s not like other topics where there is more debate among scientists. We all know it is bad for children to be separated from caregivers. Given the scientific evidence, it is malicious and amounts to child abuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a form of systemic violence, and it\u2019s becoming normalized,\u201d she said.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/psychological-damage-inflicted-by-parent-child-separation-is-deep-long-lasting/", "title": "The Psychological Effects of Forced Parent-Child Separation", "description": "Here's what happens in the brain and the body when a child is forcibly separated from his or her parents.", "type": "website", "image": "https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/original_images/child-separation_2048x1152.jpg"}, "tags": ["Tech + Engineering", "Planet Earth", "Body + Brain", "Evolution", "Nature", "Military + Espionage", "Space + Flight", "Ancient Worlds", "Physics + Math"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/wgbh/nova/article/epigenetics-abuse/", "/wgbh/nova/article/stress-from-poverty-decreases-child-brain-sizes-even-at-birth/", "/wgbh/nova/video/separation-and-childrens-brains/", "http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/newsletters.html", "http://www.apa.org/advocacy/immigration/separating-families-letter.pdf", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/us/politics/trump-immigration-children-executive-order.html", "https://help.pbs.org/support/solutions/articles/5000677869-online-sponsorship-support/", "https://apnews.com/dc0c9a5134d14862ba7c7ad9a811160e", "https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(98)00017-8/abstract", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3115616/", "https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/18/17474986/family-separation-border-video", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoncXfYBAVI", "https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/psychological-damage-inflicted-by-parent-child-separation-is-deep-long-lasting/", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/psychological-damage-inflicted-by-parent-child-separation-is-deep-long-lasting/", "mailto:?body=From%20Nova%20|%20PBS%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/psychological-damage-inflicted-by-parent-child-separation-is-deep-long-lasting/%0D%0A%0D%0A"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018-06-20T20:00:00.000Z"}
