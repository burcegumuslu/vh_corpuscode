And while there are signs of improvement, in large part because of donor funding, it remains badly broken even as the new quasi-civilian government moves forward with political reforms.\n\nBefore military rulers handed over power two years ago, they were spending as little as $1 per person on health every year, and there were few sufficiently trained personnel or supplies, resulting in spiraling rates of diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis, infant mortality and deaths linked to malaria.\n\nIn the last year, the Ministry of Health quadrupled its budget \u2014 though still far from the amount needed \u2014 and has worked to strengthen ties with the international health community.\n\nExperts from across the globe were gathering in Yangon this week for a two-day symposium aimed at finding ways to speed up diagnosis of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, improve patient care and take advantage of new shortened and less toxic treatments.\n\n\u201cWe are still in the early days, but the political willingness is there,\u201d said Unni Karunakara, the international president of Doctors Without Borders, which hosted the event with the World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s coming at just the right time,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is an urgent need to ramp up treatment.\u201d\n\nHIV drugs are also lacking in the nation of 60 million, and UNAIDS estimates 18,000 people die from the disease every year, many of them succumbing \u2014 when their immune systems are weak \u2014 to TB.\n\nTuberculosis is an age-old scourge and one of the world\u2019s most infectious killers affecting 12 million people, according to WHO. With 506 sufferers per 100,000 people, Myanmar\u2019s rate of regular TB is three times the global average.\n\nThe normal strain of TB is easy to treat with a simple and cheap drug regimen.\n\nBut when those medications are misused or mismanaged \u2014 often when patients skip pills \u2014 the bacteria can fight back and outsmart the drugs, creating resistance. The result is a new, much harder to treat multi-drug-resistant strain. Drugs used to treat it are 100 times more expensive, highly toxic and require a longer period of treatment.\n\nFor many patients, it\u2019s too much. They give up.\n\nThough there are an estimated 9,000 new infections of this drug-resistant TB every year in the country, according to WHO, but as of 2012 only 800 patients have ever received treatment. It\u2019s a worrying problem since this dangerous strain also can be spread via coughs and sneezes, usually infecting people in close contact.\n\nThar Tun Kyaw, director of the ministry\u2019s disease control program, worries the real number of infections could be higher, noting the country has only two laboratories capable of testing patients for drug resistant TB \u2014 one in Yangon and the other in Mandalay.\n\n\u201cSo this is a big gap for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are trying to intensify detection of active cases.\u201d\n\nThere may also be countless hidden cases in areas that have been long cut off by civil unrest and rough terrain.\n\nCurrently, the few patients in Myanmar lucky enough to get treatment for drug-resistant TB receive it free of charge.\n\nBut with the numbers increasing, the government still needs to come up with $41 million for its ambitious five-year $53 million expansion plan. Most of the money contributed so far, has come from international donors.\n\nEamonn Murphy, UNAIDS country coordinator who works closely on tuberculosis, said while outside help is for the moment key to tackling drug-resistant TB, the ultimate goal should be to get the government to build up its share.\n\n\u201cThis is crucial for future suitability,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a communicable disease program run by NGOs forever.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Myanmar facing 'urgent' drug-resistant TB threat", "url": "https://apnews.com/general-news-65db7d1854e7401f9d06f3ce9fa6fc20", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/dcac1a4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/700x394+0+28/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F90%2F29%2F4e3c1cc7446089a9101a7bdff4c8%2Fdefaultshareimage-copy.png", "image:url": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/dcac1a4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/700x394+0+28/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F90%2F29%2F4e3c1cc7446089a9101a7bdff4c8%2Fdefaultshareimage-copy.png", "image:width": "1440", "image:height": "810", "image:type": "image/png", "description": "YANGON, Myanmar (AP) \u2014 Twice a month, Min Naing Oo visits emaciated patients at a Myanmar clinic, urging them through his face-mask to keep taking their medicine no matter how sick it makes them.", "site_name": "AP News", "type": "article", "article:author": "https://apnews.com/author/robin-mcdowell", "article:published_time": "2013-08-23T08:28:47", "article:modified_time": "2023-12-22T06:09:02.551", "article:tag": "General news"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013-08-23T08:28:47"}
