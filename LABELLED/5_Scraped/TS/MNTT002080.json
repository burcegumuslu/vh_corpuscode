Firefighters are frequently exposed to toxic chemicals. And, according to recent research, even their protective gear may carry health risks. Stephanie Sy went to San Francisco to look into so-called forever chemicals and their possible effects on these essential workers.\n\u2022 At the gym where I was working out, I started to urinate blood. Within a week or two, I was \u2014 I found out that I had a tumor in my kidney and had to had my kidney removed. So, my doctor at UCSF told me that the type of cancer I had is normally found in people that are heavy smokers or are in the chemical industry. I was neither.\n\u2022 Over the years, awareness has spread about the hazards of certain flame-retardant materials that, when burned, produce toxic smoke. More recently, a commonly used firefighting foam has come under scrutiny. It contains extremely high levels of perfluorinated chemicals known by their acronym, PFAS, or PFAS. They have been manufactured by 3M and DuPont since the 1940s. And they take so long to break down, they are called forever chemicals. They are in everything from nonstick cookware to raincoats. As a result, almost all of us have traces of PFAS in our blood. But researchers say firefighters are exposed to much higher levels, including in the protective gear they're required to wear.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "title": "How firefighters' life-saving work puts them at a higher risk of cancer", "description": "The life expectancy for firefighters is ten years less than the average person and it\u2019s not just the fires themselves that present dangers.
