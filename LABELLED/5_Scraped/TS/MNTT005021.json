That shortcut has come under increasing scrutiny from and .\n\nThe FDA is requiring Biogen to continue studying the drug in a trial of people who carry the genetic mutation but do not yet have ALS symptoms.\n\nALS patients hope the decision could lay the groundwork for more expedited approvals to fight the disease, which affects 16,000 to 32,000 people in the U.S. The FDA has long used accelerated approval to speed the availability of drugs for cancer and other deadly conditions.\n\nThe drug, tofersen, is designed to block the genetic messengers that produce a toxic form of protein that is thought to drive the disease in about 2% of ALS patients. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Biogen will sell it under the brand name Qalsody. Patients receive three initial spinal injections of the drug over a two-week period, followed by a monthly dose. The most common side effects linked to the drug were pain, fatigue and increased spinal fluid.\n\nBiogen\u2019s 100-person study failed to show that the drug significantly slowed the disease compared with a dummy treatment. Patients were tracked for more than six months using a scale that measures the decline of basic movements, including writing, walking and climbing stairs.\n\nBut those who received tofersen showed significant changes in levels of the toxic protein and a second neurological chemical that is considered a key indicator of the disease\u2019s progression.\n\n\u201cThe findings are reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit in patients,\u201d the FDA said in a statement announcing the approval.\n\nLast month an outside panel of FDA advisers voted unanimously that those changes warranted granting conditional approval while more data is gathered to confirm the drug\u2019s benefit. The same panel said Biogen\u2019s current data, including the failed patient study, wasn\u2019t strong enough to warrant full approval.\n\nFDA regulators have the authority to from drugs that fail to live up to their expected promise, though , they rarely used that power. In recent years, the FDA has stepped up efforts to force unproven drugs off the market, amid criticism that too many expensive, ineffective medications remain available for years.\n\nAt the same time, the FDA has shown increased \u201cregulatory flexibility\u201d in approving drugs for rare and debilitating neurological diseases, including and .\n\nIn September, the FDA to another ALS drug based on one small, mid-stage study in which patients appeared to progress more slowly and survive several months longer. Normally, the FDA requires two large studies or one study suggesting a \u201cvery persuasive\u201d improvement in survival.\n\nSome insurers have limited access to the new drug , Relyvrio, citing its uncertain benefit and $158,000-per-year cost.\n\nBiogen did not announce a price for its drug Tuesday but said it will be \u201ccomparable to other recently launched ALS treatments.\u201d\n\nThe ALS Association and other patient groups hailed the approval.\n\n\u201cThis is the second time in less than a year our community gets to celebrate the approval of a new drug to treat ALS and we have great hope for the future,\u201d said Calaneet Balas, the group\u2019s president and CEO.\n\nSince last year\u2019s approval of Relyvrio, ALS patients and advocates have to consider for the disease. That includes an experimental stem cell treatment from tiny drugmaker Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics.\n\nIn a rare move, the FDA recently agreed to hold a public meeting on the treatment, despite previously refusing to consider the company\u2019s application, citing failed results from its principal study.\n\nThe FDA has now approved four medications for ALS, only one of which has been shown to extend life. The disease gradually destroys nerve connections needed for basic movements and \u2014 eventually \u2014 breathing. There is no cure and most people die within three to five years of diagnosis.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
