The other patients are improving, he said.\n\n\u201cThe Health Ministry cannot risk recommending something that doesn\u2019t have a scientific basis,\u201d said Miguel \u00c1ngel Delgado, a senior ministry official.\n\nHowever, Bolivia\u2019s opposition-controlled congress is promoting the use of chlorine dioxide. Last week, the Senate approved a bill authorizing the emergency \u201cmanufacture, marketing, supply and use of chlorine dioxide solution for the prevention and treatment of coronavirus.\u201d\n\nThe bill would require the approval of interim President Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez, who is in quarantine after testing positive for the new coronavirus. She has sparred with opposition lawmakers loyal to Evo Morales, the former leader who was forced to resign last year after an election marred by irregularities.\n\nMany fearful residents in Cochabamba, where opposition support is strong, are giving chlorine dioxide a try. Cochabamba has reported about 440 deaths from COVID-19, or one-quarter of the total number of reported deaths in Bolivia. The real toll is believed to be higher.\n\n\u201cI am afraid. I have to try it,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Poma, a 34-year-old teacher who is skeptical that beleaguered health services can help him if he gets sick. \u201cWhat am I going to do? Wait to die at the door of the hospital or at the door of my house?\u201d\n\nFederico Anza, who sells chlorine dioxide at his Cochabamba store, said thousands of people have bought it, consuming it in drops.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I took it and nothing happened to us,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said his clients had not fallen ill after taking the agent, though provincial health authorities reported 10 cases of poisoning from chlorine dioxide in the past week.\n\nThe governor of Cochabamba state, Esther Soria, said she supports a plan for a state law authorizing the use of chlorine dioxide and traditional medicine to treat COVID-19. Cochabamba\u2019s mayor, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Leyes, said he favors the free distribution of the bleaching agent to treat patients.\n\nBut Fernando Rengel, president of the Cochabamba\u2019s scientific association, said there are old beliefs that the toxic substance is \u201cmiraculous\u201d and cures cancer, AIDS, malaria and other diseases, \u201cbut there is no scientific study that proves that it cures any disease.\u201d\n\nChlorine dioxide is one of a number of fake cures that have been promoted, often by fringe groups online, since the pandemic began.\n\nIn April, a federal judge in South Florida ordered a Colombia-based group, the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing, to stop selling a related product, Miracle Mineral Solution, in the U.S. Prosecutors said Genesis marketed the solution as a treatment for COVID-19, autism and other ailments.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has previously issued public warnings that MMS can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and severe dehydration.\n\nIn April, U.S. President Donald Trump mused about whether disinfectants could be injected or ingested to fight COVID-19, prompting intense blowback from doctors and other health officials.", "opengraph": {"title": "In Bolivian city, people buy fake - and toxic - virus cure", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-health-bolivia-ap-top-news-pandemics-97afc6e9f07751ba14493a4587ff26dc", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/bb0ae70/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1688+0+71/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fafs-prod%2Fmedia%2F1ed454634f6e49b4b8980005b78f3ad9%2F3000.jpeg", "image:url": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/bb0ae70/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1688+0+71/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fafs-prod%2Fmedia%2F1ed454634f6e49b4b8980005b78f3ad9%2F3000.jpeg", "image:width": "1440", "image:height": "810", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "image:alt": "Health workers carry an empty coffin into the San Jose nursing home to recover the body of an recently deceases resident, in Cochabamba, Bolivia, Thursday, July 16, 2020.
