Outside Shot\n\n A Patient's Quest\n\n To Save New Drug\n\n Hits Market Reality 'We Have to Follow the Science' By AMY DOCKSER MARCUS \n\nStaff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\n\n November 16, 2004; Page A1 ST. LOUIS -- Elizabeth Grubesich was cooking in her bright yellow and white kitchen in August 2002, when she got a call from her doctor. He told her the cancer drug she believed was keeping her alive would no longer be available. The company making it had decided to stop producing it. She left the cooking unfinished, sat down at the kitchen table and cried in her husband's arms. Since she began taking the experimental drug, her tumors had gotten smaller and she felt good enough to garden and swim. \"I had never met a metastatic breast-cancer patient who was experiencing the kind of health I was,\" says Ms. Grubesich, 55 years old. \"To let this thing go down the tubes seemed insane to me.\" It took her two days to calm down. Then she decided to try to save TriAb, a cancer drug made by Titan Pharmaceuticals Inc., a biotechnology company in South San Francisco, Calif. \n\n Efforts Emerge to Recognize Symptoms Earlier A Guide to Which of the New Tests Are Worth Getting Health Journal: Cancer Where You Least Expect It: Analyzing Risks in Your Family Tree Aches & Claims: Diet May Have an Effect on Prostate Cancer Advances in biotechnology and a surge of investor money have sparked a huge increase in the number of cancer drugs under development. That means patients have a greater likelihood of finding a treatment that can help them. But the explosion of new drugs under development is forcing tough decisions about which ones eventually get to market. If a drug shows benefits for most patients in early trials, companies are likely to continue with further tests. If only a small number of patients improve, companies often won't spend the money to determine why those individuals seemed to respond. Later-stage trials can cost millions of dollars and take years to complete. Many new drugs fail because companies \"want to hit a home run\" in early tests, says Jeffrey Schlom, chief of the Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology at the National Cancer Institute who has spent years working on cancer vaccines. The pressure for a success is especially high on biotech upstarts like Titan that go public without any products on the market, with investors betting on their potential to come up with a hit. In a two-year quest to keep her drug alive, Ms. Grubesich made personal appeals. She sent thank-you cards to executives at the company that made it, telling them they had made a difference in her life, and often enclosing her picture. She spent hours on the phone with a public-health specialist at the Food and Drug Administration, to whom she recalls losing her temper and saying: \"Don't tell me you're looking out for my interests. If you're looking out for my interests, you'd approve TriAb.\" She even tracked down and met the co-inventor of the drug, encouraging him to find another company to produce it. \"No one anticipated this situation several decades ago,\" says Janet L. Woodcock, director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the FDA. In the past, chemotherapy treatments were so harsh it wasn't a possibility for patients to stay on a drug for years. Either the cancer was wiped out, or the patient died. New \"targeted\" treatments and vaccines have fewer side effects, offering the promise of extending lives for years. \"We now have many situations where companies may not want to continue development of a drug, but a small population of people who feel they benefited desire to remain on that product for a long time,\" Dr. Woodcock says. Ms. Grubesich was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1994, seven months after she got married. She was 45 then, the executive director of two homeless shelters in the St. Louis area. A routine mammogram turned up something suspicious. \"I wore a beige and orange-flowered spring skirt and blouse that day,\" she wrote in a personal account of her treatment. \"I've never worn that outfit since. It feels so ugly to me now.\" Her doctor told her to give up plans to try to get pregnant. She had surgery, chemotherapy and radiation treatments. By February 1995, the treatment was over. Doctors told her she was disease-free. She went back to work. Three years later, a pain in her back seemed to be getting worse. After she had an X-ray, she was told the cancer had returned. She had metastatic breast cancer, meaning it had spread to other organs. \"This was despair,\" she wrote. \"I really was facing death now.\" She had just turned 50 when she started a year-long chemotherapy regimen, including weekly treatments of two cancer drugs. The cancer continued to grow. Her oncologist switched her to a much harsher regimen. For six months, she suffered nausea, fevers, fatigue and joint pain. Her face and arms broke out in red patches that burned. Her throat and tongue turned white and her eyes were swollen shut. \"My life, what I could do and give, was getting smaller and smaller,\" she wrote. The weekly chemotherapy was so toxic she felt \"the treatment was worse than death for me at times.\" In 2000, she started searching for other options. She learned that Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis was enrolling metastatic-breast-cancer patients in a trial for a new treatment. Women would be given a bone-marrow transplant, along with shots of a promising new vaccine called TriAb. The only expected side effect from the vaccine was a large bump on the leg the day of the shot. Ms. Grubesich signed on. Most vaccines are given to healthy people and designed to prevent disease. But so-called therapeutic vaccines, such as the one Ms. Grubesich received, are given to treat existing cancer. These vaccines try to jump-start the body's own immune system, to attack the cancer. While vaccines remain a hot area of research, there are no therapeutic cancer vaccines yet on the market. As part of her trial, Ms. Grubesich's bone marrow -- the material inside bones that produces blood cells -- was removed, frozen and stored. She then was given a single 96-hour dose of chemotherapy to try to eradicate her cancer. After that, the stored blood cells were put back in her, to replace bone marrow damaged by the chemo. Following the transplant, she and others in the trial received monthly injections of TriAb for two years. Most advanced breast-cancer patients eventually relapse. The idea in this test was to give women the vaccine at a time when they had very little tumor left. The hope was that their juiced-up immune system would then kill any tumor cells the chemo didn't get. It took a year before Ms. Grubesich felt truly well again. She felt good enough to take classes in botany and Irish history, swim regularly, and cook special meals. As her health improved, she says she felt a sense of wonder that she was still alive. She started gardening again, growing vegetables. She read voraciously, especially mysteries. Every month, she went back to the hospital for the vaccine. Ms. Grubesich's experience with TriAb remains \"remarkable and scientifically promising,\" says her doctor, John DiPersio, chief of oncology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. But, he adds, \"not all scientifically promising drugs move forward.\" In August 2002, she got the phone call from Dr. DiPersio, saying TriAb was essentially finished. For some patients, like Ms. Grubesich, the treatment seemed to work wonders. But for most others, their cancer progressed. Even in the women who seemed to be doing well, it wasn't clear if it was the vaccine or something else -- perhaps the bone-marrow transplant -- that was responsible. In a written statement, Titan, the company making the vaccine, said that while it couldn't \"rule out the possibility\" that certain individuals were benefiting from TriAb, its studies didn't show enough \"evidence of benefit to justify continuing development.\" Titan decided it would stop making new batches of the drug. \"We have to follow the science,\" says Louis R. Bucalo, Titan's chief executive officer. \"That is the only way we can help the most people with the resources that we have.\" Titan, a small biotech company with fewer than 100 employees, was eager for a success. Founded in 1993, it went public three years later. As of Sept. 30, Titan reported approximately $43.2 million in cash and marketable securities. The company has used a strategy common to biotech concerns -- licensing new drugs from university labs, hoping to pick a winner. Its stock price has fallen dramatically in recent years, hurt by earlier setbacks in trials of its drugs, as well as a general decline in biotech stocks. Titan's stock peaked at $65 a share in 2000; by December 2002, it had plummeted to $1.43 a share. Its stock yesterday rose 10 cents to $2.16 as of 4 p.m. in American Stock Exchange composite trading. Titan currently has six drugs in various stages of testing. This year, the FDA granted Titan \"fast track\" status for its drug to treat advanced Parkinson's disease, a designation which expedites the approval process. Dr. Bucalo says the company is developing \"other products in our portfolio that we consider more promising\" than TriAb, including a drug for schizophrenia, now in late-stage testing. But the company still doesn't have a product on the market. The revolution in new cancer treatments is forcing the FDA to recognize that certain drugs will benefit only small groups. In a few cases -- such as with Iressa, a lung-cancer drug from AstraZeneca PLC -- the agency has approved a drug when only a small percentage of people benefited. But in that instance, there were few other options available to patients. TriAb, by contrast, would be competing against an array of treatments for breast cancer, according to oncologists familiar with the trials, making it difficult to get FDA approval without demonstrating clear, dramatic benefits. Because Ms. Grubesich was doing so well on TriAb, her doctor set up a \"single-patient compassionate usage trial\" for her -- allowing her to stay on the drug after her trial ended. Titan agreed to give her 12 more vials for free. The FDA says such arrangements aren't uncommon, although not every patient knows about, or is motivated enough to push for a single-patient trial. Still, Ms. Grubesich knew that was only a temporary solution. She wanted the drug around permanently. She began pursuing leads on how to save the drug. She personally lobbied the company, with two goals. She wanted to get as many vials of the drug as possible for her own use. But she also hoped her story might encourage company officials to consider further trials. In both instances, she felt \"it would be more difficult for Titan to say no to a patient than a doctor or a hospital.\" She struggled to understand the science behind the vaccine. In March 2003, she brought in a published report from her own TriAb trial to discuss with Dr. DiPersio. According to the paper, the majority of the 54 women in her trial had immune responses to the vaccine -- in other words, their bodies produced cells to attack cancer. And nearly one-third of the women saw their tumors stabilize or shrink over three years. To Ms. Grubesich, that seemed like wonderful news. \"People under a death sentence would take those odds,\" she said. \"I know I would.\" But 68% of the women in her trial saw their cancer progress. And even among the patients who improved, investigators said it wasn't clear if it was the vaccine or some other factor that was responsible for their results. More study would be needed, they said. Without a larger, broader trial, \"the drug won't fly,\" her doctor told her. In July 2003, when her year's supply of TriAb was almost up, Ms. Grubesich contacted Frank Burroughs, president of a patient-advocacy group called the Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Developmental Drugs. Together, they drafted a press release they hoped to send to the media. They had a mixture of motives: pressure Titan to revive TriAb, galvanize breast-cancer activists to back it, and get more drug for Ms. Grubesich. \"You would think that a drug that works dramatically better than the standard treatment for metastatic breast-cancer patients in a phase I/II clinical trial would be big news,\" the statement opened. TriAb was a nontoxic alternative that kept her cancer stable, it said. \"TriAb not only saved my life,\" she wrote. \"It gave me a life worth living.\" Mr. Burroughs showed the statement to Titan's chief financial officer, Robert Farrell, saying they wanted to send it out as a testimonial to how well the drug worked. But Titan felt Ms. Grubesich's statement might be misleading. The company says it \"emphasized to her and her physicians that there was no clear scientific evidence that the drug was helping her.\" Still, Titan agreed to send Ms. Grubesich another 12 vials of TriAb, enough to last her until October 2004. She and Mr. Burroughs agreed to Titan's request not to send out a press release. Earlier this year, Ms. Grubesich contacted Titan one more time, asking for another year's supply. This time, Titan said no. Existing supplies were running out, and no new batches were being made. Ms. Grubesich started searching for the drug in other places. On the National Cancer Institute's Web site, she found a trial of the drug that had been planned for other hospitals around the country. The trial had been scaled down after researchers learned Titan was going to stop making the drug. She got the name of the trial's principal investigator, at the University of Chicago Hospital, contacted the nurse in his office and asked about any extra TriAb vials. The nurse found four at the hospital pharmacy that weren't being used. If Titan agreed, the hospital might consider transferring them, Ms. Grubesich was told. Elated, she called Titan in May, asking permission to use those four vials. Titan declined, saying it was concerned about regulations on transferring a drug from one site to another. Instead, it agreed to send her two more months' worth of TriAb, to let her continue treatment to the end of this year. By then, she would have received four years of TriAb -- twice as long as was called for in the protocol to test the drug. While she still felt angry that Titan wasn't moving forward with TriAb, Ms. Grubesich says she was gaining a better understanding of the obstacles the company faced. \"Cancer patients need to understand the politics surrounding their drug,\" she says. On the Web, a friend of Ms. Grubesich's located a copy of the patent Titan filed for her drug. \"The government may have certain rights in this invention,\" the patent stated, because some funding for the research and early trials had come from the National Cancer Institute. \"Can the NCI intervene?\" Ms. Grubesich scribbled on her list of leads. The NCI spent more than $20 million for research and tests of three vaccines licensed to Titan. But the institute doesn't usually get involved in a corporate decision when it doesn't own rights to an invention, or a broader public-health issue isn't at stake, says Sherry Ansher, coordinator of research and development agreements for its Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program. \"Most companies drop products for a reason,\" Dr. Ansher says. \"It's unfortunate for this individual, but our mission is the larger public health.\" Ms. Grubesich got another idea: go directly to the inventor. She read in a document Titan posted online that it agreed to \"diligently pursue a vigorous development program\" to keep rights licensed from the University of Kentucky for TriAb and two other vaccines. If Titan wasn't developing the vaccines, she thought perhaps Kentucky could get the rights back and find another company to make the drugs. Titan gave her the name of the vaccine's co-inventor, Kenneth Foon. She found him now working as deputy director for clinical investigations at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute. Calling Dr. Foon one day, she says she asked, \"Is there any way I can help save your life's work?\" In August, Dr. Foon flew to St. Louis to speak with Ms. Grubesich and Dr. DiPersio. They met one Saturday morning in a conference room at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. \"I'm scared to go off the vaccine,\" Ms. Grubesich told Dr. Foon, almost as soon as they shook hands. His coffee untouched in the center of the table, Dr. Foon spoke frankly about the drug's prospects. He wanted to help, he told her. \"I have spent the last 15 years developing the vaccines,\" he said to Ms. Grubesich. \"If I didn't believe they worked, I wouldn't keep going.\" Dr. Foon told Ms. Grubesich he would ask Kentucky to request the license back. But even if Titan agreed, he said, it would take time. \"We're moving further and further away from the data,\" he said. Without promising data, the chance of getting other companies excited about the drug diminished. Dressed in a red silk shirt and black pants, Ms. Grubesich slumped in her chair as the doctors laid out the list of obstacles preventing TriAb from being approved. At one point, Ms. Grubesich quietly asked, \"So you're saying this probably won't go?\" The two doctors were silent for a moment. \"You never know,\" Dr. DiPersio said. \"We admit we don't understand why some people do well on this vaccine.\" Dr. Bucalo, Titan's chief executive, says he is glad Ms. Grubesich has fared so well. Her personal plea to stay on the vaccine, and her oncologist's support, convinced Titan to keep providing her with vials, he says. \"We want to be compassionate and medically reasonable,\" he says. But \"it may not be medically reasonable to treat a patient indefinitely with this product.\" Titan hasn't decided whether to return the vaccine licenses to the University of Kentucky. In September, Ms. Grubesich sent her most recent thank-you note to Dr. Bucalo. She expressed gratitude for her new life. She explained that, in order to make her remaining vials of TriAb last longer, her doctor decided to space out her treatments to bimonthly instead of monthly shots. Her future seemed as uncertain as the drug's. \"I only hope that next year at this time,\" she said in the note, \"I am doing as well as I have been for the last four years.\"", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "#", "/article_print/0,,SB110056934631375066,00.html", "/article_print/0,,SB110056934631375066,00.html", "#", "/search/aggregate?article-doc-type={Health}%20&KEYWORDS=%2A&FIELD=field=vdkvgwkey%2Bmain%2Dhed%2Barticle%2Ddoc%2Ddate%2Barticle%2Ddoc%2Dpublication%2Barticle%2Ddoc%2Did%2Barticle%2Ddoc%2Dtype%2Bs%2Dmain%2Dhed&SORT_STRING=sort%2Dstring%3Darticle%2Ddoc%2Ddate%2Bdesc%2Bmain%2Dhed%2Basc&SEARCH_SECTION=article-body&COLLECTION_AGG=collection=wsjie/30day&HEADER_TEXT=HEALTH", "/article/0,,SB111238501319895724,00.html?mod=Health", "/article/0,,SB111234684383795424,00.html?mod=Health", "/search/aggregate?article-doc-type={Health}%20&KEYWORDS=%2A&FIELD=field=vdkvgwkey%2Bmain%2Dhed%2Barticle%2Ddoc%2Ddate%2Barticle%2Ddoc%2Dpublication%2Barticle%2Ddoc%2Did%2Barticle%2Ddoc%2Dtype%2Bs%2Dmain%2Dhed&SORT_STRING=sort%2Dstring%3Darticle%2Ddoc%2Ddate%2Bdesc%2Bmain%2Dhed%2Basc&SEARCH_SECTION=article-body&COLLECTION_AGG=collection=wsjie/30day&HEADER_TEXT=HEALTH", "/industry/0,,DHC,00.html", "/industry/0,,DPH,00.html", "/setup/setup_center_mainpage", "#", "/mds/companyresearch-quote.cgi?route=BOEH&template=company-research&ambiguous-purchase-template=company-research-symbol-ambiguity&profile-name=Portfolio1&profile-version=3.0&profile-type=Portfolio&profile-format-action=include&profile-read-action=skip-read&profile-write-action=skip-write&transform-value-quote-search=TTP&transform-name-quote-search=nvp-set-p-sym&nvp-companion-p-type=djn&q-match=stem&section=quote&profile-end=Portfolio&p-headline=wsjie", "/article/0,,SB110054448051774353,00.html?mod=article-outset-box", "/article/0,,SB110054444650774350,00.html?mod=article-outset-box", "/article/0,,SB110054437102574344,00.html?mod=article-outset-box", "/article/0,,SB110054440872874347,00.html?mod=article-outset-box", "/mds/companyresearch-quote.cgi?route=BOEH&template=company-research&ambiguous-purchase-template=company-research-symbol-ambiguity&profile-name=Portfolio1&profile-version=3.0&profile-type=Portfolio&profile-format-action=include&profile-read-action=skip-read&profile-write-action=skip-write&transform-value-quote-search=azn&transform-name-quote-search=nvp-set-p-sym&nvp-companion-p-type=djn&q-match=stem&section=quote&profile-end=Portfolio&p-headline=wsjie", "mailto:amy.marcus@wsj.com", "#", "#", "/article_print/0,,SB110056934631375066,00.html", "/article_print/0,,SB110056934631375066,00.html", "#", "JavaScript:CopyrightPopUp()", "JavaScript:CopyrightPopUp()", "http://ad.doubleclick.net/clk;14556044;6853491;m?http://www.xerox.com/color"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
