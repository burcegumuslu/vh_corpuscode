But the elevated risk for the heaviest users of lye-based hair products \u2013 which included about 20 percent of study participants \u2013 is concerning.\n\nThere is an urgent need to address racial disparities in breast cancer.\n\nBlack women diagnosed with breast cancer are 40 percent more likely to die from the disease than white women. While systemic factors such as delays in diagnosis and poorer health care likely contribute to this disparity, they don\u2019t seem to fully explain the survival gap between Black and white women.\n\nBlack women are more likely than white women to develop highly aggressive breast cancers that have higher mortality rates, but researchers don\u2019t really know why. However, scientists do know that chemical hair relaxers, more often used by Black women, contain potentially harmful chemicals, including possible carcinogens and chemicals known as endocrine disrupters, which can interfere with hormone function and could raise breast cancer risk. In the Black Women\u2019s Health Study, 95 percent of women reported past or current use of these products.\n\nThis study fills a knowledge gap on the potential health effects of a consumer product popular among Black women. Given these findings, women may want to be cautious about the types of personal-care products they choose.\n\nWhat still isn\u2019t known\n\nBecause the Black Women\u2019s Health Study did not have information on specific brands of hair relaxers, my team and I could not determine which specific ingredients might be most relevant for breast cancer risk. In addition, because we asked about hair relaxer use before 1997, the results of this study may not apply to products on the market today.\n\nThough our findings suggest a link between the use of certain types of hair relaxers and breast cancer, epidemiologic studies such as this one cannot definitively prove that hair relaxers cause breast cancer. Additional research is needed, especially on currently available products.\n\nWhat other research is being done\n\nEvidence from animal and other experimental studies support a possible link between chemicals included in hair relaxers and cancer development. Studies on hair relaxer use and breast cancer risk in people, however, have had inconsistent results, possibly because of differences in the types of products used or asked about.\n\nThanks to 59,000 study participants in the Black Women\u2019s Health Study, our research team continues to investigate risk factors for breast cancer and other diseases in Black women. By understanding what causes disease and learning about ways to lower risk, society can move one step closer toward eliminating health disparities.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
