There are around 4,500 of these fluorine-based compounds and they are found in almost every dwelling on Earth in products including food packaging, non-stick cookware, rain gear, adhesives, paper and paints.\n\nThey have been identified in low levels in rainwater globally - but if they infiltrate water or soil in high level, they can become a serious concern.\n\nExisting methods to destroy PFAS, such as incineration, have not been very successful - they can be prohibitively expensive or have been associated with local contamination.\n\nThis could be very useful in helping communities suffering from high-level contamination, according to Prof Sunderland, who is not part of the research team.\n\nBut it is these bonds which means they can repel liquids - known as omniphobic - and makes them very useful for the pharmaceutical and food industries.\n\nThe research team, led by Brittany Trang, identified a new mechanism to break down the PFAS by using a common chemical called sodium hydroxide - which is used to make household products like soap or painkillers.\n\nWith PFAS remaining in production it can continue to build up at low levels in fish and other wildlife as it cannot be broken down naturally very easily.\n\nDr Alexander-White says that PFAS should only be used in products and processes that are vital for society and for which there is no alternative.", "opengraph": {"article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "description": "US scientists have discovered a low-cost method for destroying chemicals associated with cancer.", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13CE4/production/_126342118_makeup_pfas.jpg", "image:alt": "Makeup palettes and brushes on table surface", "locale": "en_GB", "site_name": "BBC News", "title": "Breakthrough over potentially harmful chemicals found in most homes", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-62561756", "article:section": "Science & Environment"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#comments", "https://www.epa.gov/pfas/our-current-understanding-human-health-and-environmental-risks-pfas", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-62391069", "https://www.epa.gov/pfas/our-current-understanding-human-health-and-environmental-risks-pfas", "https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220512-the-chemicals-that-linger-for-decades-in-your-blood", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-62391069", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-58595098", "https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?dirEntryId=349938&Lab=CCTE", "https://echo.epa.gov/tools/data-downloads/national-pfas-datasets", "https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.abm8868", "/news/topics/c302m85q152t", "/news/topics/cnx753jenyjt", "/news/science-environment-62391069", "/news/business-58595098", "/news/science-environment-60761972"], "authors": ["By Esme Stallard"], "publish_date": "2022-08-19T00:58:58.000Z"}
