In China, where the pandemic began, officials made unsubstantiated claims that traditional medicine was key to fighting the virus. In Venezuela, where the health care system is severely crimped, President Nicolas Maduro pitched drinking an herbal tea.\n\nThe World Health Organization had advised against taking \u201ctraditional herbal remedies\u201d on its website. It later acknowledged that some were turning to alternative medicine \u201cto alleviate some of the milder symptoms of COVID-19,\u201d WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic said.\n\nDr. Mike Ryan, WHO\u2019s emergencies chief, welcomed rigorous studies of alternative treatments \u201clike we would of any drug.\u201d He said numerous studies are underway in China, many testing traditional therapies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to the people who make the claim to provide the evidence,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Barrett, a retired psychiatrist who runs Quackwatch, a website about unproven medical therapies.\n\nOn Thursday, the warned against alternative medicine \u2014 including certain herbal therapies and teas \u2014 for treating or preventing COVID-19, saying there was no evidence they work and some may be unsafe.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at the claims:\n\nIndia is steeped in Ayurveda, a Hindu system of medicine that revolves around herbal medicines and dietary restrictions.\n\nAs the outbreak spread outside China earlier this year, India\u2019s health arm that promotes alternative medicine pushed unproven remedies to \u201cstrengthen the immune system,\u201d according to an online post by the Ministry of AYUSH.\n\nCriticism prompted the government to clarify that these remedies were not a cure. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended India\u2019s lockdown and asked citizens to \u201cfollow the instructions issued by AYUSH ministry to enhance immunity.\u201d\n\nThe government also recommended a single dose of a homeopathic drug, according to Anu Kapoor, who heads a government-run homeopathic hospital in New Delhi.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t been shown to work, said Dr. Anant Bhan, a public health specialist. \u201cThe same standards should apply. Especially for times like this,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Indian government\u2019s push for alternative treatments for COVID-19, combined with bizarre claims by the elected representatives of the ruling Bhartiya Janta Party that cow urine or dung could offer cures, has also resulted in misinformation.\n\nLast month, Modi spoke to alternative medical professionals on the need to counter unsubstantiated claims that they could cure COVID-19. The AYUSH ministry later issued orders to all states \u201cto stop and prevent publicity and advertisement\u201d of promised cures.\n\nThe Chinese government has claimed that combining herbal medicine with conventional medicine has helped the country deal with the outbreak.\n\nLast month, China\u2019s National Health Commission issued a document on treating COVID-19 patients that included several herbal medicines claiming to relieve symptoms like weakness and fever.\n\nFor infected patients, it prescribed, among other remedies, a \u201csoup for clearing and detoxifying the lungs\u201d and recommended a case-by-case evaluation.\n\nChinese officials and state-run media have touted treating patients with alternative medicine on health care workers exposed to the virus.\n\nBut some published reports in major medical journals of large numbers of patients treated in China make no mention of alternative medicine. Instead, they note that treatment revolved around established methods such as respiratory support, drugs to help prevent additional infections such as bacterial pneumonia, and other widely accepted therapies.\n\nZhong Nanshan, an epidemiologist who advised the government, said earlier this year that it\u2019s testing Chinese herbal medicines.\n\nSome of these practices have existed for centuries. But with little or no scientific evidence that they work against COVID-19, attempts have been made to frame it as a cultural issue and not a scientific one.\n\nPromoting treatments \u201cwithout an adequate scientific basis\u201d was worrying, said Dr. Daniel Kuritzkes of Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.\n\nSome of these preparations can be toxic, harm the liver or interfere with other drugs, and \u201cyou need to do the hard work\u201d to prove them safe, he said.\n\nWang reported from Beijing.
