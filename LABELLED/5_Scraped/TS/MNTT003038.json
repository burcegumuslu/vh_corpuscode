Other fans were injured.\n\nRace promoter Mojave Desert Racing had a BLM permit for the event, which has raised questions about oversight and safety at the races on federal land.\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol Officer Joaquin Zubieta said Brett M. Sloppy, 28, of San Marcos, was behind the wheel of the truck involved in the crash. Zubieta said alcohol was not a factor in the crash and there were no plans to arrest Sloppy, who the CHP estimates was going 45 to 50 mph at the time of the crash.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/feds-to-review-off-road-wreck-that-killed-8-fans/", "title": "Feds to Review Off-Road Wreck that Killed 8 Fans", "description": "In Wake of Deadly Accident, BLM Reviewing All Off-Road Vehicle Events in Calif.
