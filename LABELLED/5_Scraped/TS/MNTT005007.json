The safety document being cited is for an unrelated cleaning product that uses the same name. That product is made by a different, U.K.-based company.\n\nmarkets that its plant-based solution can keep fruits and vegetables fresh and at their prime longer \u2014 and that it\u2019s edible, too.\n\nBut social media posts are distorting the safety of that product, known as Edipeel, by conflating it with an unrelated cleaning product that shares a name with Apeel.\n\n\u201cIf you see the Apeel logo on any fruit and veg do not buy it, this is a Bill Gates and WEF company, this chemical makes things last 3x longer and cannot be washed off, in US and Canada at the moment,\u201d a tweet reads.\n\nThe tweet includes a screenshot of a safety data sheet for a product called \u201cApeel.\u201d The document includes \u201cHazard statements\u201d that include: \u201cCauses serious eye damage,\u201d \u201cMay cause an allergic skin reaction\u201d and \u201cHarmful to aquatic life with long lasting effects.\u201d\n\nThe document being cited, however, is not for Apeel\u2019s Edipeel. It was that is a hard surface cleaner. That company\u2019s logo and name appear on the safety data sheet as well.\n\nApeel Sciences representatives emphasized that their produce-protecting product is not related to the cleaner and that it is safe to consume.\n\nThe company uses plant lipids or plant oils naturally found in fruits and vegetables and creates a coating applied \u201cto the surface of fresh fruits and vegetables in order to retain moisture and reduce oxidation,\u201d said Jenny Du, co-founder of Apeel and senior vice president of operations. \u201cOur product is also intended to be edible.\u201d\n\nof purified monoglycerides and diglycerides, which Du pointed out are also found in products such as infant formula; the compounds are by the Food and Drug Administration as a , or GRAS, food additive. In the U.S., Apeel\u2019s coating is such as avocados and apples.\n\nConfusion with the unrelated cleaning product hasn\u2019t been an issue until the most recent bout of misrepresentations online, Du said. She pointed out that there is also an Australian company that manufactures an that could be stirring further confusion.\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate thing is of course you can have different companies with similar names, trademarked as such, when they are very different industrial classes,\u201d said Du, who holds a Ph. D. in chemistry.\n\nApeel Sciences did receive early developmental support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in and again in\n\nThis is part of AP\u2019s effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.
