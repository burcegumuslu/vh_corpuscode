But, he added, it doesn\u2019t mean the treatment should be used by men without low T \u2014 a condition also known as hypogonadism that\u2019s measured by levels of the sex hormone in the blood.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve shown here is that for a very specific group of men, testosterone can be given safely,\u201d Nissen said. \u201cBut it is not to be given as an anti-aging tonic for widespread use in men who are aging.\u201d\n\nMore than 5,000 men ages 45-80 at 316 trial sites throughout the U.S. were randomly assigned to get the testosterone gel or the placebo, which they rubbed on their skin daily for an average of about 22 months. \u201cMajor cardiac events\u201d occurred in 182 patients in the testosterone group and 190 patients in the placebo group.\n\nThe testosterone group did have a higher incidence of less severe problems, such as atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury and issues from blood clots in veins.\n\nThe large study helps address \u201ca gap of understanding\u201d about how testosterone treatment affects cardiovascular outcomes for men with true low T, said Dr. Alan Baik, a cardiologist at the University of California-San Francisco who was not involved in the research.\n\nBut he\u2019d like to see more research, he said, on whether testosterone therapy can actually reduce cardiovascular risk factors in men with low T, who seem more likely to have conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes.\n\nTreating low T has been a big business for many years, largely driven by advertisements for pills, patches, gels and injections. Online sites and clinics across the nation offer the treatment, and many tie low T to common issues such as fatigue and weight gain.\n\nThe new study, led by the Cleveland Clinic and funded by a consortium of drug companies, was done in response to a 2015 mandate by the Food and Drug Administration for makers of testosterone products to carefully examine the risk of heart attack or stroke. A previous FDA review had shown that many men got low T treatment even though their testosterone levels hadn\u2019t been checked.\n\nNissen said while low T is a \u201cvery common disorder,\u201d aging men also want to feel like they\u2019re 18 again and \u201chave the sexual performance they had when they were young,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the treatment, he added, \u201cshould not be used by bodybuilders. It should not be used by athletes. The concerns about the misuse of testosterone are quite high. And I think we have to be very cautious.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
