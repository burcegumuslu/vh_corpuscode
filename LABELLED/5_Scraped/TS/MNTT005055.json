Theories include the possibility that violence is driven by the prevalence of guns in America, or by less aggressive police tactics or a decline in prosecutions for misdemeanor weapon offenses, Nagin said.\n\nOnly the Idaho killings fit the definition of a in which four or more people die, not including the shooter. However, the number of injured in most of the weekend cases matches the widely accepted definition for mass shootings.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the shootings this weekend:\n\nFive people were shot, two fatally on the city\u2019s South Side on Sunday evening when someone from a car that pulled up to a gathering, according to police.\n\nAnother , one fatally, during an altercation in a garage in the West Side neighborhood of Austin around 3 a.m. Sunday, police said.

Col. George Bivens.\n\n\u201cWhat I witnessed ... was one of the most intense, unbelievable gunfights I have ever witnessed,\u201d Bivens said, lauding troopers for launching an aggressive search despite facing a weapon that \u201cwould defeat any of the body armor that they had available to them.\u201d\n\nA motive was not immediately known.\n\nA shooting at a pool party at a home left eight people wounded, authorities said Saturday.\n\nAuthorities were dispatched shortly after midnight in Carson, California, south of Los Angeles, KABC-TV .\n\nThe victims range in age from 16 to 24, the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department said.\n\nSix people were injured in a Friday night .
