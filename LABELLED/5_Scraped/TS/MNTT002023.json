These doctors say don\u2019t buy it", "cleaned_text": "In the vast, wild world of Instagram beauty influencers, there\u2019s a new category of products on the block: masks, sprays, lipsticks and other cosmetics for\u2026vulvas.\n\nThey promise to make vulvas \u2014 the outside portion of the sex organ where clothes touch the skin \u2014 glowier, fresher and softer.\n\n\u201cIt makes them, like, really pretty,\u201d one Instagram ad declares.\n\nBut what the influencers and the companies behind them aren\u2019t telling you: Vulvas and vaginas don\u2019t naturally need these products \u2014 and in fact, they could have harmful side effects, according to medical professionals who spoke with the PBS NewsHour.\n\nThere\u2019s a massive lack of research on vulvas and vaginas in general, and we don\u2019t know the long-term effects of these products. But studies tell us that messing with the vaginal microbiome, which protects vaginas from odors, infections and sexually transmitted diseases, can come with major effects.\n\nThere are two main types of products to note: cosmetic beauty products for vulvas \u2014 think exfoliators, highlighters and lotions \u2014 and pseudo-health products for vaginas, like over-the-counter boric acid suppositories for yeast infections.\n\nWhile many companies entice millennials and Gen Zers through body positivity and empowerment, some of these new kinds of products echo a centuries-old idea that vaginas and uteri need to be cleansed and freshened.\n\nBut \u201cyour vagina is a self-cleaning oven,\u201d said Dr. Jen Gunter, an OB/GYN, a self-described advocate for factual medical information and author of the new book \u201cThe Vagina Bible.\u201d The vulva can mostly protect itself and only needs to be cleaned occasionally, she added.\n\nLike the rest of our skin, vulvas are protected by the acid mantle, a thin film which guards against bacteria, viruses and other contaminants. Some of these products have high pH values, which can affect the skin\u2019s acid mantle, making people more vulnerable to odor and infection, Dr. Gunter said.\n\nThese products can also claim to tackle vaginal health issues without approval from the Food and Drug Administration, and the brands rely on confusing marketing tactics, neglecting to provide data on product safety and effectiveness.\n\nSomething smells fishy, so here\u2019s what you should know about these products and vulvar health.\n\nBiology says these products aren\u2019t always necessary\n\nThere\u2019s a centuries-old idea that vaginas and uteri need to be cleansed and freshened.\n\nIn reality, doctors say the vulva and vagina can largely take care of themselves. Vulvas only need to be cleaned occasionally, and vaginas should be left alone unless there\u2019s a problem.\n\nIt\u2019s when people interfere with those areas \u2014 through beauty treatments like waxing, shaving or laser treatment \u2014 that problems are more likely to begin, doctors said. A 2014 study found almost 90 percent of women remove pubic hair, and 60 percent of those subjects experienced at least one minor complication, such as ingrown hairs and rashes.\n\nShaving can also cause abrasion and irritation, and without moisture-locking hairs, skin can become dry and itchy.\n\nIt \u201ctakes a lot to remove pubic hair,\u201d said Dr. Cheryl Iglesia, director of urogynecology at MedStar Health and OB/GYN professor at Georgetown University. \u201cAnd that leads to having the need for skin products for that area.\u201d\n\nSome of the products you use to treat that irritation, however, can also spur skin issues. One study from the University of Minnesota found that 54 different personal hygiene wipes contained more than 132 potential allergenic ingredients.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re doing all this hair removal, you can make small cuts that can lead to little abscesses and boils,\u201d Dr. Iglesia said. Iglesia mentioned that this can make you a little bit more susceptible to staph infections and STDs, and that doctors have seen the antibiotic-resistant superbug MRSA of the vulva, too.\n\nBut how can companies sell products that are unapproved or lightly tested?\n\nIf a cosmetic product promises a change in the body\u2019s structure or function, whether that\u2019s an antiperspirant that keeps you dry or a pill that reduces fevers, it must get approval from the FDA, said Francis Palumbo, executive director of the University of Maryland\u2019s Center on Drugs and Public Policy.\n\nThat raises some red flags with companies like Queen V, whose \u201cinstagrammable\u201d products have transitioned onto shelves in Walmart and Free People. Queen V advertises vaginal suppositories that \u201cprevent infection\u201d and bath bombs that \u201crelieve menstrual cramps.\u201d\n\nAn FDA representative told the PBS NewsHour that the agency could not find a listed drug from Queen V, and Queen V declined to provide information on product safety and effectiveness.\n\nThat shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. Cosmetic manufacturers run their own product tests, but the data is hard to come by, so we don\u2019t know much about the metrics and results. Palumbo agreed that consumers don\u2019t know if these products actually do what is promised or are certified safe.\n\nMoreover, the FDA doesn\u2019t always pursue cosmetics with health claims, Palumbo said, because the agency lacks the workforce for inspections. Even if a product claims to be a homeopathic drug, the FDA validation process would be much less strict than the standard drug approval procedures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even close,\u201d Palumbo said. \u201cBasically, it\u2019s a loophole.\u201d\n\nSo what should you do?\n\nGunter warned against introducing any \u201cimprovement\u201d or \u201cwellness\u201d product (vulvar or vaginal) into the vagina.\n\nA number of studies have pointed to the wide variety of risks that come along with that practice. Inserting over-the-counter vaginal products can increase bacterial vaginosis rates \u2014 one study found women were 3 to 10 percent more likely to contract the condition when using these products. Another study of Kenyan female sex workers found that washing the vagina with soap raised HIV transmission rates almost four times; washing with just water almost tripled that rate.\n\nA 2016 study from the National Institute of Environmental Health Studies found that women who douched regularly were twice as likely to develop ovarian cancer than those who didn\u2019t. This disproportionately affects people of color, who douche and use feminine products at higher rates than white people.\n\nGunter said washing habits are a personal choice \u2014 \u201cthere\u2019s nothing wrong with self-care as long as it\u2019s not causing a medical problem\u201d \u2014 but she recommends using water and sometimes a gentle cleanser to maintain the vulvar acid mantle.\n\nAnd if something feels wrong about your vulvar or vaginal health, \u201cyou should not go to the drugstore,\u201d Gunter said. \u201cYou should go see a gynecologist.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "title": "Beauty products for vulvas?
