BBC Future analyses the evidence.\n\nMelanoma is one of the deadliest cancers. It\u2019s also one that \u2013 while still the least common form of skin cancer \u2013 is rising in prevalence around the world. Since the early 1990s, rates of melanoma in the UK have increased among every age group. Rates of non-melanoma have increased too. In the US alone, cases of non-melanoma skin cancers have grown by around 77% over the past two decades. Exposure to UV radiation is the main cause of the most common forms of skin cancer. And one of the most effective ways to avoid it, of course, is sunscreen. \u201cAny conversation on sunscreen must start with acknowledging that there is robust evidence that it prevents skin cancer,\u201d says Richard Weller, honorary consultant dermatologist at the University of Edinburgh. This is why, although skin cancer is rising in some countries, it\u2019s decreasing in others \u2013 particularly those that have raised the most awareness around the importance of using sunscreen. \u201cSkin cancer rates are increasing among older generations \u2013 they\u2019re carrying damage from decades earlier in their lives, because things have changed now,\u201d says Adele Green, senior scientist of the cancer and population studies group at QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Australia. \u201cCountries where rates are falling have had the biggest investments in communicating awareness, such as New Zealand, Denmark, the US and Australia.\u201d You might also like:\n\u2022 The \u2018silent killer\u2019 of Africa\u2019s albinos\n\u2022 Should everyone be taking vitamin D?\n\u2022 How to spot misleading health news But some researchers have raised concerns that, despite being an undeniably important tool in our fight against skin cancer, the formulation of sunscreen may need to be improved to contain safer ingredients \u2013 and, at worst, some sunscreens could be damaging our health.\n\nIt\u2019s long been established that some organic filters are absorbed through the skin and into the bloodstream. This alone doesn\u2019t mean sunscreen is unsafe, but there is growing focus on the potential adverse effects of the most common UV filter worldwide: oxybenzone. \u201cLittle is known about systemic exposure for most active ingredients\u201d in sunscreens, the FDA stated in its report, referring to the effects of large volumes of sunscreen absorbed through the skin and into the body. FDA scientists authored a paper focusing on four ingredients found in sunscreen into the skin, including oxybenzone, and concluded that absorption of sunscreen into the body may be more than a theoretical concern. However, the trial was very small \u2013 involving only 24 people. Some lab and mice studies have found that some organic UV filters, including oxybenzone, as well as ingredients including parabens and phthalates, which can be found even in sunscreens that use inorganic UV filters, are suspected endocrine disrupters: chemicals that interfere with our hormones. But no research on humans has backed this up. Laura Vandenberg, associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst's School of Public Health and Health Sciences, says most endocrine disrupters affect male foetuses and embryos.\n\nHigh-level exposure to phthalates, in particular, has been found to disrupt development of male genitals. This could lead to problems later in life, such as reduced sperm count or increased risk of testicular cancer. However, this effect has only been found in very high doses. These compounds aren\u2019t just in sunscreens, either. Phthalates also can be found in various other cosmetics, including some soaps, shampoos, nail polishes and hair sprays, and parabens are in many hair care and make-up products Meanwhile, Vandenberg has found through her research that oxybenzone can affect the size of mice\u2019s mammary glands. Oxybenzone also has been detected in breast milk. That means it could also be in the breast tissue, Vandenberg says, which could affect its development, function and health. However, we should always be cautious when applying the findings of mice studies to humans, says David Leffell, professor of dermatology and surgery at Yale School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research. Critics also say research showing adverse effects of UV filters on rodents typically involved much higher levels of UV filters than human use. For example, in 2011, a group of researchers writing in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives put into perspective the findings of one study from 2001. In that study, researchers observed that feeding oxybenzone to young rats caused their uteruses to grow by 23%.\n\nWhile this is an important finding, the study does have limitations, Leffell notes, which Louis acknowledges in the paper. These limitations include reliance on only one urine measurement, and the possible variability of the concentration of UV filters measured, as their concentration lowers quickly when in the body. While it\u2019s reasonable to be concerned about the clinical impact of certain benzophenones, regardless of their source, Leffell adds that the study doesn\u2019t draw any definite conclusions. Aside from any one precise ingredient, there are concerns that sunscreen prevents the human body from making vitamin D, which we mostly get from Sun exposure. After all, vitamin D deficiency might be more prevalent than we think \u2013 could sunscreen use be to blame? It shouldn\u2019t be a major cause, says Rachel Neale, associate professor at QIMR Berghofer. \u201cThe mechanism of sunburn is different to vitamin D production, and there is a weight of evidence suggesting that applying sunscreen doesn\u2019t seem to influence vitamin D levels much,\u201d says Neale. \u201cWe\u2019re very good at making vitamin D. And sunscreen isn\u2019t like being inside a room \u2013 it screens the Sun out and still lets some through.\u201d A panel of 13 leading experts from around the world met in 2018 to discuss the balance of vitamin D and Sun protection and concluded that sunscreens are unlikely to affect the vitamin D status of healthy adults.\n\nFor those concerned about getting enough vitamin D, Neale still advises wearing sunscreen every day for those living in places where there\u2019s strong sunshine all year round, like Australia. But in places where the Sun isn\u2019t so strong, like the UK, she says it\u2019s easy to get vitamin D from Sun exposure because sunscreen usually is only needed when you\u2019re outdoors for an extended period of time. Concerns around sunscreen blocking vitamin D production also may be overstated because so few people use sunscreen correctly, according to Weller. It\u2019s advised we apply two mg/cm2 to our skin, around six teaspoons, which is the amount used to determine a products\u2019 Sun protection factor (SPF). Most people apply around a quarter of that, he says. But could Sun exposure provide benefits other than vitamin D? It\u2019s important to note that any argument emphasising the Sun\u2019s health benefits, rather than risks, remains a controversial theory \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t negate the warning that exposure increases the risk of skin cancer however we\u2019re exposed to it. Still, one such benefit could be that UV radiation releases nitric oxide, a molecule produced in the body that dilates blood vessels and lowers blood pressure, which suggests that sunscreen may prevent these benefits, according to Weller.\n\nIn one study looking at coral communities in Hong Kong waters, researchers found higher levels of sunscreen when there is increased human activity on the coast. Some coral samples contained levels high enough to cause deformities and death in immature corals. So what should someone concerned about their health, or that of the seascape, do? Until there is definitive research on the potential effects of UV filters absorbed into our bodies, or alternatives that don\u2019t contain ingredients associated with health risks, the consensus among experts is that we need to shield ourselves whenever we\u2019re exposed to the Sun. The healthiest way to do so \u2013 for both ourselves and for wildlife \u2013 is with clothing, finding shade and avoiding midday Sun. But for times that isn\u2019t possible, we should both wear sunscreen and must apply it properly. For those concerned about potential effects of UV filters being absorbed into your skin or by wildlife, a sunscreen containing inorganic filters may be the better option. That may sound simple enough. But rising skin cancer rates suggest the message has been lost.
