It will only attack and target the tumour cells.\"\n\nOnce the cells are attacked they are starved of nutrients so they do not grow.\n\n\"Therapies that currently exist are very toxic and people can become ill and quite resistant to it as well.\n\nUsing cultured cancer cells in the lab, scientists have proved that prostate tumours shrink when they are exposed to this modified strain of salmonella bacteria.", "opengraph": {"article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "description": "Scientists at Swansea University say they have made a breakthrough which could revolutionise the treatment of prostate cancer.", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17191/production/_90290649_mediaitem90290648.jpg", "image:alt": "Salmonella bacteria", "locale": "en_GB", "site_name": "BBC News", "title": "Salmonella 'game-changer' could shrink cancer cells", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-36712240", "article:section": "South West Wales"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/news/health-36433403", "/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-36084944", "/news/health-36105272", "/news/health-35861202", "/news/uk-wales-35631355"], "authors": ["BBC News"], "publish_date": "2016-07-05T10:01:11.000Z"}
