Highway 501 in Orange and Durham counties.\n\nThe herbicide will be applied in a concentration well below limits set by the EPA and is safe for humans, fish and wildlife, officials said.\n\nProperty owners adjacent to the treated section of the river will be cautioned regarding the use of river water for irrigation during Hydrilla treatment.\n\n\u201cPesticides approved for aquatic sites have passed a rigorous testing process. Fluridone is one of the least toxic among those,\u201d said Rob Emens, program manager for N.C.\u2019s Aquatic Weed Control Program. \u201cAt the rate it will be applied in the Eno, no restrictions on water use will be triggered except for irrigating certain plants and seedlings.\u201d\n\nHydrilla was first discovered in the Eno River watershed in the early 1990s in Lake Orange, which is located upstream of Hillsborough. In 2009, biologists confirmed Hydrilla in another upstream reservoir, West Fork Eno Reservoir.", "opengraph": {"title": "Crews start treating section of Eno River for invasive aquatic weed Hydrilla", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/weeds-6e7eaa28bf405d3b48509ae4047f29c0", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/dcac1a4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/700x394+0+28/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F90%2F29%2F4e3c1cc7446089a9101a7bdff4c8%2Fdefaultshareimage-copy.png", "image:url": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/dcac1a4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/700x394+0+28/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F90%2F29%2F4e3c1cc7446089a9101a7bdff4c8%2Fdefaultshareimage-copy.png", "image:width": "1440", "image:height": "810", "image:type": "image/png", "description": "Crews have started treating portions of the Eno River in Orange County with an herbicide for an infestation of Hydrilla, a non-native aquatic plant that can impact the health of fish and wildlife.", "site_name": "AP News", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "2017-06-02T18:28:27", "article:modified_time": "2021-08-15T01:20:53.183", "article:tag": "Weeds"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-06-02T18:28:27"}
