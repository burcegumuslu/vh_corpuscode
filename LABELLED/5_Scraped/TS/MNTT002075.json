However, doctors at Charite said at the moment the specific substance to which Navalny was exposed is not yet known.\n\n\u201cThe patient is in an intensive care unit and is still in an induced coma. His health is serious but there is currently no acute danger to his life,\u201d the hospital said in a statement.\n\nNavalny remained in critical but stable condition at the Berlin hospital, with special protection details on hand to ensure his safety, German officials said.\n\nBerlin police and federal agents were posted at the downtown Charit\u00e9 hospital where the 44-year-old is undergoing treatment following his arrival in Germany after Chancellor Angela Merkel personally offered the country\u2019s assistance.\n\n\u201cIt was obvious that after his arrival, protective precautions had to be taken,\u201d Merkel\u2019s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, told reporters. \u201cAfter all, this is a patient who, with a certain degree of probability, was poisoned.\u201d\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t comment on Navalny\u2019s condition, but earlier in the day, Dirk Wiese, the German government\u2019s coordinator for Eastern European affairs, told public broadcaster ZDF he was \u201ccurrently critical, but stable.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is now receiving the best possible treatment,\u201d Wiese said.\n\nREAD MORE: Russian opposition leader Navalny collapses in airplane in suspected poisoning\n\nNavalny\u2019s supporters believe that tea he drank was laced with poison \u2014 and that the Kremlin is behind both his illness and a delay in transferring him to Germany.\n\nRussian doctors have said, however, that tests have shown no traces of poison in his system. The Kremlin hasn\u2019t yet commented on the allegation.\n\nNavalny\u2019s team last week submitted a request in Russia to launch a criminal probe, but as of Monday, Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee still has not opened a case, Navalny\u2019s spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said.\n\nIlya Yashin, an opposition politician in Moscow and a close ally of Navalny, in a video statement Monday urged Russia\u2019s law enforcement to investigate \u201can attempt at a life of a public figure\u201d and to look into the possible involvement of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cIt is Putin who benefits from these endless assaults,\u201d Yashin said.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan said the Navalny case would on the agenda for Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun\u2019s visit to Russia that begins Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWith Alexei Navalny in a hospital in Berlin, our dialogue with Russia must include reemphasizing the importance of free speech and civil society,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nIf Navalny is found to have been poisoned \u201cthat would represent a crucial moment in Russia,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Russian people deserve to see that anybody who would have been involved in a matter like that be held accountable.\u201d\n\nNavalny was flown to Germany on Saturday from Siberia after much wrangling over whether he was was stable enough to be transported.\n\nAfter his arrival, hospital spokeswoman Manuela Zingl said he would be undergoing extensive diagnostic tests and that doctors wouldn\u2019t comment on his illness or treatment until they were able to evaluate the results.\n\nOn Sunday, Navalny\u2019s wife, Yulia Navalnaya, and aide Leonid Volkov visited the Russian opposition leader in the hospital, but didn\u2019t speak to reporters.\n\nNavalny, a politician and corruption investigator who is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s fiercest critics, fell ill on a flight back to Moscow from Siberia on Thursday and was taken to the hospital in the city of Omsk after the plane made an emergency landing.\n\nREAD MORE: Russian opposition leader in coma to be flown to Berlin for treatment\n\nRussian doctors on Monday said two laboratories found no poisonous substances in his system.\n\n\u201cIf we had found poisoning confirmed by something, it would have been much easier for us,\u201d said Anatoly Kalinichecnko, deputy chief doctor of the Omsk Ambulance Hospital No. 1, where Navalny was treated. \u201cBut we received a final conclusion from two laboratories that no toxic chemicals that can be considered poisons or by-products of poisons, were found.\u201d\n\nThe hospital\u2019s chief doctor, Alexander Murakhovsky, rejected allegations made by Navalny\u2019s team that doctors in Omsk had been acting in coordination with Russia\u2019s security services.\n\n\u201cWe were treating the patient, and we saved him,\u201d Murakhovsky said Monday. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t be any influence on the patient\u2019s treatment.\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t able to identify men in plainclothes spotted in the hospital last week who the politician\u2019s allies said were law enforcement and security service agents.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say who they were,\u201d Murakhovsky said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week he didn\u2019t know anything about security service operatives being present at the hospital.\n\n\u201cWe in the presidential administration can hardly be interested in who is present in the office of a chief doctor in a hospital in Omsk,\u201d Peskov said on Friday.\n\nLike many other opposition politicians in Russia, Navalny has been frequently detained by law enforcement and harassed by pro-Kremlin groups. In 2017, he was attacked by several men who threw antiseptic in his face, damaging an eye.\n\nLast year, Navalny was rushed to a hospital from jail where he was serving a sentence on charges of violating protest regulations. His team also suspected poisoning then. Doctors said he had a severe allergic reaction and sent him back to detention the following day.\n\nDaria Litvinova reported from Moscow.
