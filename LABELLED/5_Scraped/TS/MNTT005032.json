He was found dead weeks later.\n\nEdwards worked for Watford during the 1990s and possibly the 1980s.\n\nThe findings of Watford\u2019s investigation were made public on Tuesday and added to an independent report into allegations of non-recent child sexual abuse in soccer published in 2021.\n\nEdwards was alleged to have asked players to remove all clothing for treatment and would conduct unnecessary groin examinations, which included touching a boy\u2019s penis and \u201cpotentially digital penetration.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a club, Watford FC wishes to apologize to all young people who experienced the behaviour perpetrated by the late Phil Edwards, while holding a position of influence and access within the club,\u201d Watford said in a statement. \u201cWe are doing, and will continue to do, everything we can to ensure that the boys, girls, men and women who play for this club \u2014 and indeed anyone who works for or with the club \u2014 will not have to endure the experiences these young people did.\u201d\n\nAn independent review found that English soccer did not do enough to protect children from predatory coaches from 1970 to 2005.\n\nThe inquiry, led by attorney Clive Sheldon, catalogued failings by eight clubs, including Chelsea and Manchester City, to act on concerns. The 710-page report said there were at least 692 abuse survivors and 240 suspects.\n\nThe inquiry was conducted after survivors came forward in 2016 with testimonies of abuse from perpetrators such as Barry Bennell, a former youth talent scout for Manchester City. At the time of the report, Watford was in the process of investigating allegations made against Edwards.\n\nThe English Football Association has now asked for the conclusions be added to the report.\n\nThe report said Edwards \u201cappeared to enjoy inflicting pain\u201d and \u201claughed or shouted\u201d if his victims cried. It was claimed he would ask players to squat while naked and he would lie on the floor looking at them.\n\nIt was also alleged Edwards would have boys go to his house \u201cwhere he gave them alcohol, showed them pornographic films, and encouraged them to perform sexual acts with an adapted stuffed toy.\u201d\n\nWatford concluded there was \u201ca strong indication\u201d that Edwards\u2019 methods \u201cwere not only questionable, but in some cases amounted to criminal conduct.\u201d It said his actions were \u201cvoyeuristic and inappropriate.\u201d\n\nSeveral survivors said Edwards\u2019 behavior was \u201ccommon knowledge amongst club staff,\u201d that boys talked openly about him and he was referred to as \u201cPaedo Phil.\u201d Staff contacted denied knowledge of abuse.\n\nOne volunteer said he remembered Edwards hitting players\u2019 buttocks when they got off the treatment table and was \u201cpuzzled\u201d why so many players were diagnosed with having groin injuries.\n\nA survivor also said he told the then-manager, the late Graham Taylor, and other staff about the abuse. Two members of staff both denied the conversation took place.\n\nTaylor, who was a former England coach, died in January 2017, before Watford\u2019s investigation began.\n\nWatford concluded that there was no corroborating evidence that staff knew about the alleged abuse and said that no one outside of the coaching or medical staff had reason to know about it. But it left open whether coaching or medical staff had reason to know of the alleged abuse, which could have led to further enquiries.\n\nSheldon added in his analysis of Watford\u2019s conclusions that there may have been \u201cwarning signs\u201d that could have alerted coaching or medical staff to the \u201cpossibility that something untoward was taking place.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Watford apologizes to victims of former physiotherapist who allegedly abused players", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/soccer-abuse-watford-phil-edwards-fe0a9310d3add22e4554e50a17347405", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/e597ceb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4163x2342+0+217/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F1e%2Fda%2F83081c75297f2e9714ae4fe11abe%2F16e4210ec0c44c6fa6d2e33307409b06", "image:url": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/e597ceb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4163x2342+0+217/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F1e%2Fda%2F83081c75297f2e9714ae4fe11abe%2F16e4210ec0c44c6fa6d2e33307409b06", "image:width": "1440", "image:height": "810", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "image:alt": "FILE - A ball stands next to the field during the English Premier League soccer match between Watford and Leicester City at the Vicarage Road Stadium in Watford, England, on June 20, 2020.
