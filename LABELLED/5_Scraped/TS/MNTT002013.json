At many bases, virtually all waste was burned, ranging from paints, solvents, tires, plastics and Styrofoam to batteries and electronic equipment. Depending on the burn locations and prevailing winds, smoke frequently permeated these outposts and adjacent areas.\n\nThe issue appears to be personal for Biden, whose son, Beau Biden, a former Delaware attorney general, died at age 46 in May 2015 from glioblastoma multiforme, the most common form of brain cancer.\n\nAs a major in the Delaware Army National Guard, Beau Biden\u2019s judge advocate general unit was activated in late 2008. He served in Iraq for much of 2009 at Camp Victory in Baghdad and Balad Air Force Base, 50 miles north of the Iraqi capital. Both bases used large burn pits. Earlier, he helped train local prosecutors and judges in Kosovo after the 1998-1999 war.\n\nIn what appear to be the two-term vice president\u2019s first public comments about the possibility that his late son Beau Biden\u2019s brain cancer was caused by burn-pit smoke, Biden acknowledged he was unaware of \u201cany direct scientific evidence\u201d of a linkage.\n\nBut Biden, who was tapped by former President Barack Obama in early 2016 to lead the \u201cCancer Moonshot\u201d initiative, noted in the\u00ad\u00ad PBS NewsHour interview that \u201ca lot higher incidence of cancer [is] coming from Iraq now and Afghanistan than in other wars\u201d and \u201ca lot of work is being done\u201d to research it.\n\nBiden also said that reading \u201cThe Burn Pits: The Poisoning of America\u2019s Soldiers,\u201d a book on the topic by Joseph Hickman, which included a chapter on his son Beau, opened his eyes to the possibility of a link to his son\u2019s cancer.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole chapter on my son Beau in there, and that stunned me. I didn\u2019t know that,\u201d Biden said. He added, the author \u201cwent back and looked at Beau\u2019s tenure as a civilian with the U.S. attorney\u2019s office [in Kosovo] and then his year in Iraq. And he was co-located in both times near these burn pits.\u201d\n\nBiden compared living and working near a military burn pit and a factory that pollutes. \u201cWe know now you don\u2019t want to live underneath a smokestack where carcinogens are coming out of it,\u201d Biden said.\n\nA 2011 National Academy of Sciences investigation into the health hazards of burn pits, commissioned by the Veteran Affairs Department, found \u201cinadequate/insufficient evidence of an association between exposure to combustion products and cancer, respiratory disease, circulatory disease, neurologic disease, and adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes in the populations studied.\u201d\n\nHowever, the academy\u2019s 15-member expert panel also noted that \u201cinformation that would have assisted the committee in determining composition of the smoke\u201d from burn pits, which would have helped assess health hazards, \u201cwas not available,\u201d according to its report, \u201cThe Long-Term Health Consequences of Exposure To Burn Pits in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nThere is also not much data in the public record about the prevalence of glioblastoma multiforme among Afghan and Iraq war veterans.\n\n\u201cThe median age for onset of this condition (glioblastoma multiforme) is 58, and currently there is no difference in glioblastoma multiforme occurrence rates for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and the U.S. population as a whole,\u201d Curt Cashour, press secretary at Veteran Affairs, wrote in an email.\n\nRose Torres, founder of the online registry \u201cBurn Pit 360,\u201d said that 10 veterans have reported a glioblastoma multiforme diagnosis, among more than 6,000 Iraq and Afghan war veterans who have registered at the website.\n\nThe medical community appears to be divided on whether there is a connection between glioblastoma multiforme and toxic exposure.\n\n\u201cI think that it is possible\u201d that the younger Biden\u2019s cancer was caused by burn pit smoke exposure,\u201d said Dr. Tee Guidotti, an expert in environmental and occupational health, in an email. \u201cFrom what I understand, Beau Biden\u2019s exposure was significant, not modest.\u201d\n\n\u201cCancer risk is a probability, not a certainty,\u201d added Guidotti, a former chair of the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health at George Washington University Medical Center. \u201cVarious exposure risk factors increase the chance of cancer but rarely determine it for sure, [although] there are exceptions.\u201d\n\nIn general, \u201cexposure even at low levels can measurably raise the chance of developing cancer, so some cases \u2014 not many \u2014 arise from even modest exposures,\u201d Guidotti said.\n\nNeurologists appear more skeptical of a connection.\n\n\u201cThere is no association that I am aware of,\u201d said Dr. Reid Thompson, professor and chairman of the Neurological Surgery Department at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The theories linking cancer and burn pits are \u201clots of conjecture.\u201d\n\n\u201cPatients and families often believe that there is an obvious known link between various illness and exposures,\u201d Reid wrote in an email, but he evidence is lacking. \u201cFor glioblastoma, the only known risk factor is exposure to ionizing radiation,\u201d Reid said. \u201cFor brain tumors \u2014 as is true for other diseases \u2014 establishing a causal link between an exposure and the illness is really difficult.\u201d\n\nReid noted that indications of a link between environmental factors and cancers does not necessarily suggest a cause-and-effect relationship for any particular individual. \u201cUndoubtedly there are patients whose unique genetic background may make them uniquely vulnerable to a particular exposure,\u201d Reid said. \u201cUnraveling what the genetic predisposition may be \u2014 and what the exposure is for any given patient \u2014 is really one of the holy grails of medicine.\u201d\n\nBut others see it differently. \u201cThere is enough evidence to connect certain carcinogenic and neurological outcomes with exposures to multiple toxicants disbursed in the air from burn pits, as well as other toxicants in the local environment,\u201d said Dr. Victoria Cassano, a retired Navy captain and a former acting chief consultant for environmental health at the Department of Veteran Affairs.\n\n\u201cWithout making a blanket statement that all cases of GBM [glioblastoma multiforme] are due to burn-pit exposure, I believe that on a case-by-case basis, given the history and duration of exposure, an association can be made,\u201d Cassano said.\n\nCassano said oncologists \u2013 physicians who specialize in cancer treatment \u2013 are usually the first line of defense in treating brain cancers. But generally speaking, they are not well suited to \u201cconnect exposures to outcomes,\u201d Cassano said.\n\nIn contrast, Cassano said, \u201cwhat occupational physicians do is look at the epidemiology in analogous industries, look at the toxicology and the pathophysiology, and then determine if there is any plausibility in associating exposure with outcome.\u201d\n\nFor example, research has shown that firefighters who are exposed to numerous chemicals in smoke and agricultural workers exposed to pesticides while working in the field or processing produce could face a higher risk for developing cancer. Similarly, military personnel who were exposed to burn-pit smoke could have a higher risk of developing cancer, she suggested.\n\n\u201cThere is a considerable debate\u201d between neurologists, and occupational health and environment doctors, but that \u201cthe issue does not arise often enough for the differences to be talked through to consensus,\u201d Guidotti said.\n\nJill S. Barnholtz-Sloan, a professor in brain tumor research at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, said a multidisciplinary approach would help establish whether or not there is a potential relationship between burn-pit exposure and cancers.\n\n\u201cThe more perspectives you have, the more likely you are to find a solution,\u201d said Barnholtz-Sloan, though she added that too few studies have been done on the cancer and veterans to prove a link between exposure to burn pits and brain tumor risk.\n\nIn the PBS NewsHour interview, Biden himself was cautious in drawing a direct connection to burn pits and his son\u2019s cancer. Cassano agreed, warning against identifying the cause of Beau Biden\u2019s brain cancer without additional facts.\n\n\u201cI would need to know [his] family history, his history of smoking, and other positions and hobbies that may have exposed him to carcinogens,\u201d she said.\n\nDiscerning causation would likely require knowing how close his living quarters and office were to the base\u2019s burn pit, according to Cassano. Patients are also typically asked to recall how much soot and dust were in the air they breathed, she said.\n\nWithout that information, Cassano said, it\u2019s impossible to know.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "title": "Biden addresses possible link between son's fatal brain cancer and toxic military burn pits", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden said he thinks toxins found in smoke from burning waste at U.S. military installations in Iraq and at other facilities abroad could \u201cplay a significant role\u201d in causing veterans' cancer.", "image": "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2018/01/RTR3DCLQ-1024x683.jpg", "image:height": "683", "image:width": "1024", "url": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/biden-addresses-possible-link-between-sons-fatal-brain-cancer-and-toxic-military-burn-pits", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour/", "article:published_time": "2018-01-10T16:02:11-05:00", "article:section": "Health", "article:tag": "afghanistan war, burn pits, iraq war, joe biden"}, "tags": ["The Leading Edge", "Long-Term Care", "joe biden", "Supreme Court", "Essays", "Brooks and Capehart", "burn pits", "afghanistan war", "ScienceScope", "Race Matters", "Politics Monday", "iraq war", "Basic Research", "Innovation and Invention", "Teachers' Lounge"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "500", "height": "281", "embed_code": "<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YMp1SU7jvg0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/YMp1SU7jvg0?feature=oembed"}], "links": ["https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kosovo-biden-street/we-owe-you-so-much-kosovo-to-tell-biden-as-street-named-after-late-son-idUSKCN10Q17X", "https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative", "http://nationalacademies.org/hmd/Reports/2011/Long-Term-Health-Consequences-of-Exposure-to-Burn-Pits-in-Iraq-and-Afghanistan.aspx"], "authors": ["Dan Sagalyn"], "publish_date": "2018-01-10T16:02:11-05:00"}
