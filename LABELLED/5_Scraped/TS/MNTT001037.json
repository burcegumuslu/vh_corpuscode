We removed the tar from their nostrils and eyes so they could breathe and see.\"\n\nMr Levy said staff had been using vegetable oil to thin the tar, and then mayonnaise to dilute it and remove it from the sides of the stomach and intestines.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.
