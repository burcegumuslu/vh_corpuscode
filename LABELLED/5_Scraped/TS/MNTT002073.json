His testing directive was welcomed by the chemical industry and came with the added twist of winning support from animal rights activists, who aren\u2019t typically viewed as being aligned with the Trump administration.\n\nThe plan approved by Wheeler said EPA will cut back on its requests for and spending on mammal studies by 30% by 2025 and eliminate all requests and funding for animal testing by 2035.\n\nHe\u2019s directing EPA\u2019s leadership team to form a working group of agency experts to come up with a plan within six months \u201cto ensure that the agency\u2019s regulatory, compliance and enforcement activities, including chemical and pesticide approvals and agency research, remain fully protective of human health and the environment.\u201d\n\nAmong the options to animal testing that Wheeler mentioned are computer modeling and in vitro methods, which involves tests using human cells and tissues.\n\n\u201cThis is the science that is being realized right now and will be the science of the future that will truly protect public health and the environment,\u201d said Sara Amundson, president of the Humane Society\u2019s Legislative Fund.\n\nBut the Natural Resources Defense Council said in a statement that it\u2019s a mistake to scale back animal testing, which can help scientists discover life-saving treatments and identify chemicals harmful to people and the environment. The alternative methods mentioned by Wheeler can be useful but may not be sufficient, according to the organization.\n\nJennifer Sass, a senior scientist for the organization, said EPA is phasing out the tools that lay the groundwork for protecting the public from dangers like formaldehyde and chlorpyrifos, a pesticide used on crops, animals and buildings. The EPA\u2019s plan is a \u201cgift\u201d to the chemical industry that will result in a \u201crigged system that gives the green light to harmful chemicals,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOur concern is not with the alternative tests themselves,\u201d Sass said. \u201cOur concern is with how EPA is interpreting the data from them. If the tests themselves are not indicating a toxic effect, then EPA is presuming there is no toxic effect.\u201d\n\nProf. Aaron Bowman, head of Purdue University\u2019s School of Health Sciences, said the overall goal of Wheeler\u2019s plan is commendable. But added he\u2019s worried about the \u201cabsoluteness\u201d of setting such a specific timeline for eliminating animal testing.\n\n\u201cThe new testing methods may not capture fully all of human physiology,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cSo animal models help us avoid missing something unexpected and dangerous.\u201d\n\nWheeler sidestepped a question about whether the chemical industry had pushed for EPA to cut back on tests that use animals, which can take longer and cost more than alternative methods.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not been lobbied by a single chemical company on this,\u201d Wheeler said, adding he wasn\u2019t aware if any chemical companies had talked to EPA staff about the initiative. \u201cThis is a longstanding issue of interest to me, personally, and that\u2019s what brought this about.\u201d\n\nThe American Chemistry Council, an industry lobbying group whose members include Dupont and ExxonMobil Chemical Company, said in a statement that Congress had directed the EPA in 2016 to promote new alternative test methods.\n\nNew test methods \u201chave the potential to save hundreds of animals while providing more accurate information on chemical hazards, exposures and risks,\u201d the group said.\n\nAlluding to the plan\u2019s 16-year time frame, Wheeler presumed Trump will be re-elected, saying he intends to be EPA administrator for the next five years. So the success of the initiative will fall to the EPA\u2019s career staff, he said.\n\nWheeler says the EPA also is steering $4.25 million to five universities to further research alternatives to animal testing. The schools are: Johns Hopkins University, Vanderbilt University and Vanderbilt\u2019s Medical Center, Oregon State University and the University of California-Riverside.\n\nJustin Goodman, vice president of advocacy and public policy at the White Coat Waste Project, said animal testing is a bad investment for taxpayers yet has become entrenched in the culture of federal agencies. He called the initiative outlined by Wheeler a \u201cbig win for taxpayers, animals and obviously the environment.\u201d\n\nAmy Clippinger, director of the People for Ethical Treatment of Animals\u2019 regulatory testing department, said the organization intends to collaborate with federal regulatory agencies and companies to assist in the transition to alternative test methods.\n\n\u201cFor decades, there has been a misguided reliance on cruel and scientifically flawed animal tests, and the EPA\u2019s decision marks the beginning of the end of them,\u201d Clippinger said.\n\nThe EPA said the number of new pesticides submitted to the agency each year varies, and it estimated the number of vertebrates used annually in toxicology studies ranges from 20,000 to more than 100,000. The testing is conducted on a variety of species, including rats, mice and rabbits. The agency said testing waivers have led to savings of thousands of animals and millions of dollars over the last two years.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "title": "EPA to scale back use of animals to test chemical toxicity", "description": "A directive signed Tuesday by EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said that \"scientific advancements exist today\" that permit the agency to better predict potential hazards to humans while reducing or avoiding animal testing.", "image": "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2019/09/2019-06-26T172718Z_1304259813_RC1205C9F640_RTRMADP_3_USA-EPA-AIR-1024x683.jpg", "image:height": "683", "image:width": "1024", "url": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/epa-to-scale-back-use-of-animals-to-test-chemical-toxicity", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour/", "article:published_time": "2019-09-10T18:26:32-05:00", "article:section": "Nation", "article:tag": "epa"}, "tags": ["The Leading Edge", "Long-Term Care", "epa", "Supreme Court", "Essays", "Brooks and Capehart", "ScienceScope", "Race Matters", "Politics Monday", "Basic Research", "Innovation and Invention", "Teachers' Lounge"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": ["Richard Lardner, Associated Press"], "publish_date": "2019-09-10T18:26:32-05:00"}
