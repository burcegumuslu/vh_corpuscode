Trujillo, a 31-year-old Ph.D. student at the University of California, Berkeley, wanted to know why it thrived in such a range of places, and whether the evolution of the species held possibilities for future habitat conservation and restoration efforts.\n\nThe research was tragically cut short last week in Mexico, where Trujillo\u2019s father said he was shot seven times. Authorities discovered his body on June 22 in the state of Sonora, in northwest Mexico, days after his fianc\u00e9e reported him missing.\n\nThe killing has left the family reeling and searching for answers in a case that has yet again highlighted the rampant violence that plagues Mexico locations controlled by drug cartels.\n\nTrujillo drove across the Arizona border into Nogales on June 17. He spoke to his father the next day and he and his fianc\u00e9e, Roxanne Cruz-de Hoyos, chatted in the morning the day after that. He told her he was going out to collect plants and would return to his Airbnb later.\n\nCruz-de Hoyos became concerned when Trujillo didn\u2019t respond to her phone calls and text messages \u2014 they normally talked several times a day \u2014 and his Airbnb hosts said his belongings were still there but he hadn\u2019t returned. She bought a plane ticket the next day and flew down to Mexico to search.\n\nOn June 22, authorities discovered his body about 62 miles (100 kilometers) from the Airbnb. He was still inside his SUV, Cruz-de Hoyos said.\n\nShe identified him for Mexican authorities as his father rushed to get a flight out of Michigan. Both have received little information about the tragedy and are begging for the U.S. and Mexican governments for answers.\n\n\u201cEvidently he was in the wrong place,\u201d Anthony Trujillo told The Associated Press on Thursday while he waited to board a flight back home, his son\u2019s remains beside him.\n\nThe Sonora state prosecutor\u2019s office said in a statement Thursday that it is analyzing evidence \u201cto establish the facts, conditions and causes of the death.\u201d The statement did not give details about what occurred or call Trujillo\u2019s death a homicide.\n\nHis family begged him not to go to such : Sonora recorded 518 homicides through May, according to federal government data. But Trujillo believed the trip was crucial to his research.\n\nSharing a lengthy border with the U.S. , Sonora is a key route for smuggling drugs, especially fentanyl, as well as migrants, cash and weapons between the U.S. and the Sinaloa state, and the infamous cartel of the same name , further south.\n\nSonora has long been critical territory for and in recent years those rivalries have increased the level of violence and sometimes left civilian victims.\n\nCartel gunmen killed three U.S. women and six of their children near the border of Sonora and Chihuahua states in 2019. The Americans lived in of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nFor Trujillo, a scholar with ties to Arizona, Michigan, Illinois, New Mexico, California and Indigenous lands in Mexico, the buttonbush\u2019s ability to survive and thrive almost anywhere must have felt familiar.\n\nHe spent years studying it and collecting specimens, often alongside Cruz-de Hoyos \u2014 a postdoctoral fellow researching widespread tree mortality \u2014 in a big red van they bought together.\n\n\u201cWe were committed to dedicating our lives to environmental conservation and environmental research,\u201d Cruz-de Hoyos told the AP. \u201cWe felt that Indigenous hands have taken care of these lands for time immemorial.\u201d\n\nDrawn to Sonora, Trujillo hoped to connect with his Opata Indigenous roots through the group\u2019s ancestral lands in the dry, mountainous region. He ultimately wanted to apply his research to building a garden in Mexico and using the buttonbush for wetland restoration. His planned trip included three potential sites to make a final choice.\n\nWith shared ancestry in the Nahua Indigenous group, which has ties to the Aztec civilization in central Mexico, the couple pledged to merge their identities and scientific studies as part of their future together.\n\nCruz-de Hoyos had been undergoing fertility treatments for the last two years and this summer\u2019s trip to Mexico was supposed to be Trujillo\u2019s last before the couple began trying to get pregnant.\n\nThey had bought a house together, commissioned custom engagement rings and envisioned a wedding led by an Indigenous elder by the end of the year. They planned to announce their happy news in August, when Trujillo returned from his trip.\n\nCruz-de Hoyos will instead honor Trujillo with a Danza Azteca ceremony, an Indigenous spiritual tradition, in the San Francisco Bay Area after his father hosts a Catholic funeral Mass in Michigan next month.\n\nBorn March 4, 1992, in Arizona, Trujillo\u2019s family moved to Michigan during his childhood. Six kids in a blended family in a predominately white neighborhood: \u201cWe were like the Mexican Brady Bunch,\u201d his father said.\n\nTrujillo attended a boarding school in New Mexico in high school and received his undergraduate degree from Lake Forest College in Illinois. A Ford Foundation fellow, he was on track to complete his Ph.D. at Berkeley in 2025.\n\n\u201cGabe was a passionate ecologist, field biologist, and advocate for diverse voices in science,\u201d the university\u2019s Department of Integrative Biology wrote in an email to its campus community. \u201cWe all face a world that is less bright for this loss.\u201d\n\nHis mother, Gloria, died of cancer a decade ago. In addition to his father and Cruz-de Hoyos, Trujillo is survived by five siblings, six nieces and a nephew.\n\nPut him in the same space as the youngsters, his father said, and he\u2019d immediately lead them outside, tromping around for bugs and plants. He often took one niece to a pond in Michigan to search for frogs. She has named a stuffed frog in his honor.\n\n\u201cA 20-minute hike with me would take an hour because he would show me all the plants and mushrooms,\u201d Anthony Trujillo said. \u201cHe wanted to learn everything about everything.\u201d\n\nDespite years of academic achievements, Anthony Trujillo kept thinking about his son\u2019s grade school project: \u201cIf you were an object, how would you describe yourself?\u201d\n\nGabriel Trujillo, just 8 or 9 years old, wrote that he would be a stapler.\n\n\u201cWe all kind of wondered, \u2018a stapler?\u2019 Now it kind of makes sense,\u201d his father said, choking up. \u201cIt holds things together.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "A California scholar's research into a flowering shrub took him to Mexico and a violent death", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/california-scholar-killed-mexico-7c1509d5639f9dcadef132a46c379b60", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/df95aee/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2049x1153+0+192/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F25%2Fbc%2Fbf7e66d89da35133ffbde683ae2c%2F8a5aba965b6b48e4b17c0b2a37f5692b", "image:url": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/df95aee/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2049x1153+0+192/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F25%2Fbc%2Fbf7e66d89da35133ffbde683ae2c%2F8a5aba965b6b48e4b17c0b2a37f5692b", "image:width": "1440", "image:height": "810", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "image:alt": "In a photo provided by Roxanne Cruz-de Hoyos, Gabriel Trujillo conducts field research for his doctorate in Arizona.
